# This file contains the objects that will be preloaded by the
# master object when the mud is started. Most of the files are
# just loaded to make sure there are no errors in them; if there
# are, this can be seen when the mud starts up.
# Also, some areas may need to 'get booted', in which case
# they need to be preloaded too.

# First we'll preload some daemons and servers:

/bin/daemons/nature_d
/bin/daemons/skilld
/bin/daemons/remarks
/bin/daemons/groupd
/bin/daemons/lagometerd
/bin/daemons/channel_d
/bin/daemons/banish_d
/bin/daemons/smoked

# Then we'll preload the most important mudlib base objects

/lib/room
/lib/treasure
/lib/living
/lib/npc
/lib/player
/lib/weapon
/lib/armour
/lib/door
/lib/group_npc
/lib/equipped_npc
/lib/equipped_group_npc

# And finally entry points of certain areas and some
# other rooms that need to be preloaded on reboot:

/areas/tristeza/adv_guild/adv_guild
/areas/tristeza/death/death_mark
/areas/tristeza/death/death_room
/areas/tristeza/temple/grave_yard
/room/purgatory
/areas/tristeza/shops/shop
/areas/tristeza/rooms/attic
/areas/tristeza/city_daemon
/areas/tristeza/rooms/well
/room/void
/room/xyzzy_void

# All lines below these comments are for loading wizard castles.
