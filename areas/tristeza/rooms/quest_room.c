permanent quest object is created and placed in this room. It has the \
quest's name and a short description of it. To mark that a quest is solved, \
call 'set_quest(\"name\")' in the player object. The quest objects here \
must all accept the id 'quest' and the name of the coder. The objects must \
also define a function hint(), that should return a message giving a hint of \
where to start the quest. Note that players never can come here. \

by this player, otherwise 0. A new addition is the Quest Points. Every \
quest has a set quest points value. Read /bin/daemons/questd.c to see the \
points of the current quests. The quests should really be done some other \
