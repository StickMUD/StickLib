You have arrived to a large chamber. Actually it appears to be
huge. You smell the fresh air flowing in from above. This place
must be frequently used, not only because of the size or good
fresh air of the chamber, but because of large foot prints.
The prints have faint lines of small scales. It's a large
reptile, no doubt about that.
