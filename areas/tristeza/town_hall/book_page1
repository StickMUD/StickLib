ADVENTURING.

On later years, it has become more and more complicated to adventure and
gather experience. This book was written to be a guide for adventurers.

As everyone knows, the meaning of life is to gain experience and raise
your level. Raising can be done here at the adventurers guild or if you
belong to some guild then it can be done there.

The best way to get experienced is to kill monsters that live outside (or in
some cases inside) our village. You can also gain experience by doing Quests
that higher beings have set. Experience can also be gained by killing players,
but that is very risky, because they might not like it and can have protectors.

Your reputation will depend on how kind you are to other players. Playing will
be easier, if you are nice to others. High level players, especially Lords and
Ladies are known to help friendly beginners. Lords and Ladies are high level
players that have done all the Quests and gained a lot of experience. They are
very powerfull and able to make your playing much easier or harder, so remember
to behave respectfully and some of them might take you under protection.

The altogether top goal for regular players is to gain lordship.
