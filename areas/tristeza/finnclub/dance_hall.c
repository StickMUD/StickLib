There is often a band, which plays for example \"humppa\" and \
\"jenkka\", and other finnish folk dances, and - of course - tango. \
There are many singers that are very popular among the countrymen \
(you could call them rednecks...), \
for example \"Reijo Taipale\", \"Isto Hiltunen\", \"Eija Kantola\", \
\"Joel Hallikainen\", just to name a few. \
At the summer dances, \
people will drink too much, fight - with fists or knives, depending \
on the area and people's ethnic background, \
puke and piss around, and try to get laid. Ah, forgot, some \
actually come to dance. They are a minority.");
