/*
	this is a wedding manual coded by Minx....
	as far as what it does try look at manual...
	as far as the code....
	this manual counts on a few things...
	1) the bride, groom, best man, maid of honor must
		be in the game when they are used in "setparty"
	2) the bride and the groom must be set before the
		ceremony...
	3) currently the bride and groom must be set in the
		code in the carriage and the c_patio

	and I think that's it....

	Mail me if you have any questions!!! > :)
