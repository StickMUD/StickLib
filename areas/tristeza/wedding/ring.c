/* This is the master wedding/engagement ring file by Minx 
	
	*These rings are to be purchase in the jewelry shop
	(also coded by Minx). The rings are customizable, yet
	the players can do the customizing themselves with
	a minimal amount of int_arg.
	*The rings are to be purchased for the loved one not
	for themselves.
	*The prices and a description of the rings can be found
	either here, in the jeweler, or in the shop.
	*The only commands available at this time are: the two
	person channel, the showoff command (shows the ring off
	to everyone in the room), and the divorce command 
	(destroys one's ring). Sooner or later I would like to
	add a few emotes.
	*I hope all this is pretty self explainatory... if not
	I can write more later.
