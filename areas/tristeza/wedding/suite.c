of the tables there must be at least a dozen white candles of various \
sizes and shapes. In the back of the room there is a bay window and a \
sitting area, with a loveseat. In front of the loveseat a coffee table is \
set with a light snack for two. Next to the bay window French \
doors open out onto a cement balcony.  One side of the room is dominated \
by an extra large white marble fireplace. A plush bear skin rug is \
spread out before the fire.\n\

At this time there are no extra feeling commands in the room. The \
mood created here is merely based on each couples inventive emote \
style. Maybe in the future I'll add a couple of extra feelings to \
merely set the mood.\n\
