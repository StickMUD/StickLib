/*********************************************************************
  casino employee

  All the casino dealers, bouncers, etc are cloned from this object.

  The employees are very tough monsters.  They have to be so because
  the whole point of the casino is to gamble, and nobody can gamble
  if thieves steal their money.  So, these dudes have to be a 
  sufficient deterrent for thieves.  Yes, it should be (and is) possible
  to steal in the casino.  I just want it to be really risky.

  If employee is attacked, he will summon the bouncers to help him.
  Bouncers will come and help no matter where they are in the casino.
  They will also relentlessly pursue attacker until he dies or they
  die.  After attacker is dead, the bouncers return to the casino
  security room.  

  Currently, the bouncers will even pursue a player to link-death.
  This is a cool feature IMO, I don't like players who always hit
  the LD button at the first hint of trouble.
