  Abacus 
  Coded by: Germ
  Last modified: Feb 7, 1996

  The abacus functions like the HP-SP reporter with gold coins.
  When it is turned on, each heartbeat the abacus compares the gold
  that a player has with the gold they had on the previous heartbeat
  and reports the difference, if any.  If the abacus is turned off
  or dropped, its heartbeat function is also turned off.

  It is pretty cool in the casino to keep track of your long-term
  profits/losses.

  We probably don't want too many of these wandering around the mud
  because the have a heartbeat (only if they are carried by a player).
