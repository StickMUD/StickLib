This directory contains the rooms inside the Adventurers' Guild
of Main Town. To begin with, this means only one room. However,
when you build a real mud, there will probably be a few rooms
and more than one bulletin board. The example guild room that
is in StickLib should be enough to show how to add a bulletin
board.
