The purpose of this directory tree is to gather all kinds of gifts into
the same place. Gift is here a general name for a gift, a reward, an 
object that a player has bought and so on.

/lib/gift               The root directory of gifts. Put inheritable objects
                        here.
/lib/gift/gifts         The ready gift objects that are released to players.

/lib/gift/giftrules.txt The raw version of the rules. Feel free to make
                        suggestions/comments.
