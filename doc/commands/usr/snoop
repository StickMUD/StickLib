NAME
	snoop - snoop a player

SYNOPSIS
	snoop [name]

DESCRIPTION
	Sets snoop on player [name], or, without arguments, ends the
	existing snoop.

	Snooping shows everything that the snooped player gets.

	You can snoop mortals, and coders who have smalled coder level.

	Snooping should be used for debugging only. Permission to snoop
	should be asked from the player first. (Currently snoop does not
	tell the target about snooping, but that may be added later.)

	Any information that is not related to StickMUD or In-
	Character stuff is confidental. Co-Admins and Admins should
	not tell anything about that.
