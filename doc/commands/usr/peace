NAME
	peace

DESCRIPTION
	Shows if there is Peace upon the world, i.e. are player
	kills allowed or not.

	Co-admins can set or clear Peace (argument 1 or 0).

	Peace is handled by /bin/daemons/peaced.c, and the
	flag is _saved_! If peace is on, it _will_ stay after
	reboot!

	Peace is hard coded into /obj/living.c, to the same
	place is PK/non-PK areas. Also it is checked in room
	code: all rooms are "non-PK" if Peace is set.

	I coded it so that we can fix the guilds in peace.
