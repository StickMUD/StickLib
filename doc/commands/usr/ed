NAME
	ed - text editor

SYNOPSIS
	ed [file]
	ed here

DESCRIPTION
	Starts editing the file 'file'. For documentations about how to use
	'ed', look at /doc/build. The ed also contains an internal help
	system. Give command 'h' while in ed.

	You can leave 'ed' with the command 'q', or 'Q' if the file has been
	modified.

	When in 'ed', the prompt will change to ':'.

	The file will be searched for in the current directory. There is
	one exception. If you give 'here' as file name the editor will
	try to start editing the file that defines your current environment.

	A coder can only edit files in his home directory, /open, /ftp,
	/log (limited), and possibly elsewhere if given extra access.

	'ed' without arguments will edit the last file with an error in,
	either run time error, or compile time error. So, when you log in to
	the game, start with 'ed' to see if you have had any errors.
