Command: cat <file>
===================

Print the file 'file'. If the file is long then you will see only the first
40 lines. If you give 'here' as filename the game tries to show you the
contents of the file that defines your environment.

The file will be searched for in the current directory. 'cat castle.c' will
print the castle of the wizard. 'cat' isn't really good for looking at game
files, but rather better for reading documentation.

Only Arch wizards and higher can read files from other wizards. Files from the
basic adventure can be read by all wizards.
