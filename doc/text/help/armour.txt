Armour is worn to protect your character from the cruel, uncaring foes that wish for you to have a bad day.  There are currently 13 types of armour:

* Helmet
* Mask
* Amulet
* Necklace
* Bracers
* Gloves
* Ring
* Belt
* Leggings
* Boots
* Cloak
* Shield
* Body armour

Worn armour will feel as if it is lighter (up to 50%) than armour that is carried.  There are unique pieces of armour that may have special tendencies such as making your character heal faster or have more spell points.  Rare sets of armour also exist that magically bind together several of the different types of armour listed above that provide great and mysterious powers.
