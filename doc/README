This directory contains the documentation files of StickLib.
Its structured as follows:

- Documentation about gamedriver, and closely related low level
  documents are in following directories:

  o /doc/LPC contains documentation about LPC, the language in
    which all program code in the mud is written.
  o /doc/applied contains documentation about the functions that
    the gamedriver may (directly) call on objects. Some documents
    here are out-of-date, however.
  o /doc/concepts contains documents that describe certain fundamental
    concepts about LPC, gamedriver, and the way LP-muds work in
    general.
  o /doc/driver contains documentation about hard-coded commands,
    commands that are directly defined by the gamedriver, and that
    can usually only be used by coders.
  o /doc/efun contains manual pages of all efuns LPC has. That is,
    functions that are globally defined and can be used by LPC
    program code.
  o /doc/master contains documentation about the functions that
    the master object (which is /secure/master.c in StickLib)
    can (and usually has to) define, and that affect certain
    parameters; file access and such.

- Player help-files; help files for commands, some generic descriptions
  about what the game is all about and such:

  o /doc/help/commands contains (player) command help files.
  o /doc/help/topics contains help files for various topics.
  o /doc/help/bonus contains some miscellaneous extra documentation.

- Documentation about StickLib, the mudlib of this mud. That is the
  part of the game written in LPC, without the stuff "built on top
  of it", ie. areas and guilds:

  o /doc/dev documents how objects of the mudlib are to be used;
    shows some examples, defines guidelines about certain values.
    The directory is further divided in:

	- /doc/dev/armour: Documentation about generic armours.
	- /doc/dev/balance: Documentation about balance.
	- /doc/dev/generic: Documentation about other misc objects
		mudlib contains.
	- /doc/dev/guild: Documentation about guilds.
	- /doc/dev/npc: Documentation about generic NPCs.
	- /doc/dev/room: Documentation about room objects.
	- /doc/dev/weapon: Documentation about generic weapons.
	- /doc/dev/virtual: Documentation about virtual areas;
		how they are created and configured.

  o /doc/std contains documents about how the mudlib objects
    actually work, and API (Application Programming Interface)
    you have to use when configuring and interacting with them.
    Like /doc/dev, this directory is further divided in sub-
    directories. These subdirectories are the same as in
    /doc/dev.

- Man-pages (manual-pages, unix-talk) of coder commands; commands
  that only coders can use:

  o /doc/commands/usr: The man-pages for normal coder commands.


Note that the easiest way to access the help-files is to use command
"help", like "help help" to know more about the help-command and
so on. This checks for documentation found from /doc/help.

The easiest way to access other documentation is to use coder-commands
"man"; as with 'help', "man man" can be used to know more about
the command...
