13-Jan-97 / Graah: This is just a suggestion, not the law - yet.
		   But there will (and must) be _some_!

0. General Stuff

-	ALL guilds MUST use the balance daemon, there's nothing
	better at the moment, no one seems to have the time or
	skill to code anything better (balance daemon was _not_
	ready when people started to use it :)

-	Percentages in the balance daemon show what the guild
	is about: if a guild has 20% in offensive powers, the
	powers obviously do not include fireballs, summoned
	demons, or backstabbing. Examples:

	Percent	Attack			Defence
	  25%	1 minor, limited	no special defences!
	  50%	couple of minor		short-duration defences
	  75%	1 major, a few minor	minor long duration one
	 100%	many major attacks	one constant one plus others

	Guilds with constant defences (e.g. healers) must always
	completely suck with their attacks! And vice versa: if
	your guild throws multi-room attacks, your defences must
	suck! Summoned creatures are very problematic, they can
	be both an attack AND a defence. Generally, all summoned
	creatures - the BEST ones - must be equal to, let's say, a
	cityguard sergeant!

-	ALL guilds MUST have skills. There can NOT be level-based
	powers, unless it is a channel... or something like that;
	i.e. doesn't affect _any_ stats of _anything_.

-	Well, channels are actually too good a power - number of
	channels should be reduced a LOT! Besides, ALL channels
	should be handled by one server - they would all have
	compatible commands, and that would free a lot of disk
	space.... Channel logs will be a problem, though.


1. Offensive Powers

-	Use the balance daemon.
-	Every offensive power MUST CHECK PK AREA!
-	Every offensive power MUST SET PK FLAG!
-	No offensive power is allowed to affect people in /room/church.c!

Easiest way to do all this is 'if (ob->attacked_by(attacker))...'


2. Defensive Powers

-	Use the balance daemon.


3. Summoned/Created Creatures

-	Number of creatures per player MUST be limited! Absolute
	maximum number of creatures assisting one player is
	...twelve (12)? (Too much? Too little? I'd say even ONE
	is more than enough, but...)

4. Building Items

-	All potions MUST use the normal drink rules (delay etc.)!
