Hints for newbies from Graah
----------------------------

'report on' is very useful - check 'help report' also.

Keep your wimpy high - at least 30-40 %.

I'd suggest you to run away _before_ you flee...you'll find out why...

Remember to 'rest' or 'sit' when you are not exploring or fighting.

Learn the places of healing (the Sauna, Eastroad Inn, the Healer etc.)

Beware the nasty, contagious diseases the mud has :-)
