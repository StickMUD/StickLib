NAME
	weapon - some information concerning weapons

DESCRIPTION
	There are many kinds of weapons in the world of StickMud:

	Sharp weapons - swords, knives, axes etc. These are often the best
	weapons. They tend to break and become dull, though.

	Blunt weapons - maces, clubs, hammers etc. Often, these are not
	as good as sharp weapons, but that's not a rule. It all depends on
	which weapon type suits you best (look below).
	Blunt weapons can break too, but they won't become dull.

	One and two-handed weapons. You cannot wear a shield with a two-
	handed weapon, but two-handed weapons do more damage than one-
	handed ones.

	However, what weapon is best, isn't all that clear anymore,
	because weapons now also have type; meaning that weapons are
	grouped together as "clubs", "swords" and so on. Each weapon
	type gives certain amount of bonus from strength and dexterity,
	but some (like clubs) stress strength while giving only marginal
	bonus from dexterity, whereas others (daggers for example) stress
	dexterity over strength.

	So, generally, different races usually prefer to use certain types
	of weapons; trolls certainly benefit from using clubs, maces and
	hammers, while hobbits tend to favour daggers. Dwarves, for example,
	may prefer axes, which give more bonus from strength, but still some
	from dexterity.
