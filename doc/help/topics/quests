Quests are simple or multiple 'tasks' or 'missions' you need to solve to gain
extra advantage on different subjects.

There are quests you need to solve in order to be able to advance your
attributes, and then there are voluntary quests which are just for fun and
the Big Reward at the end of the quest.

Currently, for more information about quests, visit the Adventurers' Guild.
