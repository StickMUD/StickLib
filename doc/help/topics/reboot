A 'reboot' here means that the mud will shut down, and all the players are
thrown out. The mud will open again in one or two minutes after that. Reason
for the reboots is that the system constantly keeps on eating more and more
memory, and it needs to be 'flushed', and that is done at reboots.

There are five scheduled reboots in StickMUD each week. Every work day
the game will reboot at 10:00 am local time (EET, which is GMT+2).
You can see the time from and time to next reboot with the 'uptime' command.
Notice that in most other lpmuds the time between reboots is normally
much shorter (12 hours is not usually considered short).

There might also be additional reboots when the (co)admins are adding new
features to the game. Also the machine the mud is running on may crash or
reboot, but these both cases are very rare.

All scheduled reboots (not crashes) are announced in about 30 minutes before
to advice people to sell their stuff and leave the game. Linkdead players will
have automagically their stuff sold to the shops.

If there was no announcement before the reboot, then it was a crash. Crashes
are very rare, and normally they have nothing to do with the game itself.
Even if those extremely rare occasions when the game crashes many times in a
short period of time, there is no point of demanding an answer why it crashed.
The (co)admins are busy searching and fixing the causes (or consequences), and
might have short tempers (meaning that annoying players are punished).
