Hobbits
======

Name: Homo periannath (Homo diminutivins)

Physical: Hobbits are small hominids with extraordinary speed
and dexterity. They are tough and healthy, but not strong.
Hobbits have extremely acute hearing, and while small, are
good fighters. They are similar to dwarves in stature, but
not as brawny. Hobbits are susceptible to many of the human
diseases, but heal at a modest rate if injured.

Mental: Hobbits exhibit average to high intellect, with quick
wits being their strong point. They are very adept at learning,
being able to master any weapon or object (such as a lockpick)
with little effort.

Culture: Hobbits are gregarious creatures, although they do use
the human language exclusively. They like to chat (and share meals!)
with members of all races, although they do have an aversion to
trolls. Being a sneaky folk, many non-hobbits heal uncomfortable
with hobbits near.

Attributes: Hobbits are tough, small, quick race capable of great
feats of dexterity and subterfuge. Hobbits have been observed to
attack a monster and leave the room before the opponent could
react. Almost natural thieves, hobbits are of average intelligence
and voracious appetites. A full grown hobbit will eat as much as
an adult troll. They like to have 6 warm meals a day. Hobbits also
drink vast amounts of alcohol with little effect.
