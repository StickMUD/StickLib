NAME
	fatigue

DESCRIPTION
	Fatigue points are used for physical actions, just as
	spell points are used for mental skills and magic. Your
	total amount of fatigue depends on your strength and
	constitution stats.

	(More doc coming up soon...)

	Some races heal fatigue faster than the others.
	The best are Trolls and Dwarves, then Half-Orcs, Hobbits,
	and Humans, in that order.
