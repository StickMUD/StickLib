Dark Elves
==========

Name: Moreldar quendi (Homo nyx quentis, rarely accepted)

Physical: Dark elves are a fairy race, beautiful but alien by
human standards. Tall and lithe, they appear weak and fragile
to mortal hominids or goblinoids. Elves are extremely healthy,
being immune to all known diseases. Elves are also immortal
for all practical arguments. They can see perfectly in darkness,
but hate the light of the Sun. Their pointed ears hear better
than of any race, except perhaps hobbits. Elves heal moderately
when injured, but do not fatigue mentally to any noticeable effect.
They are considerable weaker than other races. Elves have little
tolerance for alcohol.

Mental: Even the most skilled of human magic users consider
dark elves to be extraordinary magicians. Dark elves have
intellectual powers far beyond that of other races and make
the best magic users. Dark elves learn to handle even the
most complicated weapons and tools quickly and easily.

Culture: Dark elves are evil, sadistic monsters of the
Underworld. They hate almost all other races, but especially
elves. They are greatly feared by other races save trolls,
which are almost allies, though not their friends.

Attributes: Extraordinarily intelligent and very dexterous
dark elves make excellent magic users. They are a bit weak
and frail for melee combat, but are extremely ferocious and
skillful when required. Dark elves are unable or unwilling
to carry large loads, but do require less nourishment than
other races. They also rebound from mental exertions much
more quickly than other races.
