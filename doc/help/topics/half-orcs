Half - Orcs
===========


Name: Goblinous psuedosapiens

Physical: The result of perverse interbreeding between humans
and orcs, half-orcs retain many of the best (or worst) qualities
of both species. Half-orcs are very powerful creatures, with
great strength and moderate speed. They are generally healthy,
although do fall prey to several common diseases. They can see
in the dark to some extent. Half-orcs are considered unattractive
by most other races, but they do occasionally practice some form
of personal hygiene. Half-orcs do heal quickly, although any
mental effort tires them considerably.

Mental: Half-orcs did inherit about half the intelligence of
their human ancestors. They are marginal magic users, but better
than the other goblinoids. Half-orcs are capable of learning
to use the most complicated weapons if given enough time to practice.

Culture: Half-orcs have retained the tribe system of their orcish
relatives, and are able to speak in the orcish tongue. They do
associate with other races, and have become civilized to the
point of living in houses and towns. Half-orcs have a deep
rooted racial hatred of the elves.

Attributes: Half-orcs are not very dexterous, and are somewhat
slow intellectually. They can carry rather large loads due to
their strength. They have a custom of devouring the corpses of
their slain enemies after battle, but are at least civilized
enough to wait until the fight is over, unlike trolls. Half-orcs
are tough fighters who can take a great deal of damage and
still fight.
