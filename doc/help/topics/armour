NAME
	armour - some information concering armours

DESCRIPTION
	There are lots of different pieces of armour in the world.
	The most important one is the armour suit; often called
	just 'mail' or 'armour'. For example: "leather armour",
	"chain mail", "full plate". Magic-users might have
	problems with their spells if they wear heavy armour.

	Other kinds of armour give extra protection. These include
	for example: amulets, belts, girdles, boots, bracers, greaves,
	leggings, cloaks, gloves, helmets, masks and shields. Certain
	magic rings will also give protection.

	NOTE: Worn armour "weighs less" than armour you carry; this
	is to simulate the fact that you don't have to "carry" armours
	that are worn. Armours weight about 1/2 of their "normal"
	weight when worn.
