Dwarves
======

Name: Homo petrous (sps. khazad or naugrim also exist)

Physical: Dwarves are short, stocky hominids with a racially
characteristic beard (both male and female). They have the best
night vision of any race, and are among the hardiest of races
known. Dwarves are very strong and somewhat dexterous. They
have extremely well developed musculature. They are susceptible
to most human diseases.

Dwarves are comfortable in the darkness, but also in daylight.
They can see perfectly in both! This is an unique advantage
which only the dwarves have (the poor bearded guys can't even
have the stomach to devour corpses you know).

Mental: Dwarves are much smarter than the goblinoid races, but
lack intelligence in comparison to the other hominids. They
are be no means dumb however. The use of tools and weapons
come naturally to all dwarves, and they are very adept at
caring for their own weapons. All dwarves are born with the
instinctual ability to work metal and sharpen (use command 'fix'
now!) their own weapons.

Culture: Dwarves are clannish and prefer the company of other
dwarves. They generally converse in the dwarven language, but
are adept with the human tongue as well. Dwarves are polite
and courteous to other races, but do not go out of their way
to be friendly.

Attributes: Dwarves are tough and hardy. They can carry more
than any race but trolls. Very skilled with weapons, dwarves
tire much less easily than other races, and are extraordinary
melee fighters. They like to drink and do not get drunk as
easily as other hominids.

Stats:	Max. HP: 420
	Max. SP: 241
	Max. FP: 397

NOTE:  A dwarf with maxed stats will be quite giant-like,
very vigorous, extremely agile and somewhat smart.
