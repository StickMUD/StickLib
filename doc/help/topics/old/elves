Elves
====

Name: Eldar quendi (Homo quentis, rarely accepted)

Physical: Elves are a fairy race, extremely beautiful by
human standards. Tall and lithe, they appear weak and fragile
to mortal hominids or goblinoids. Elves are extremely healthy,
being immune to all known diseases. Elves are also immortal
for all practical arguments. They have exceptional eyesight,
and their pointed ears hear better than any race, except perhaps
hobbits. Elves heal moderately when injured, but do not fatigue
mentally to any noticeable effect. They are considerable weaker
than other races. Elves have little tolerance for alcohol.

Mental: Even the most skilled of human magic users consider
elves to be extraordinary magicians. Elves have intellectual
powers far beyond that of other races and make the best magic
users. Elves learn to handle even the most complicated weapons
and tools quickly and easily.

Culture: Elves are rather carefree and happy folk. A bit
standoffish from other races, they use the human tongue to be
polite, but prefer to speak in their own rich language when
among their kin. Elves are helpful towards other races, but
do have a deep rooted enmity for half-orcs.

Attributes: Extraordinarily intelligent and very dexterous elves
make excellent magic users. They are a bit weak and frail for
melee combat, but are extremely brave and skillful when
required. Elves are unable or unwilling to care large loads,
but do require less nourishment than other races. They also
rebound from mental exertions much more quickly than other races.

Stats:	Max. HP: 370
	Max. SP: 466

NOTE:  An elf with maxed stats is considered extremely muscled,
extremely healthy, quite fast and rather visionary.
