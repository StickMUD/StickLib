Trolls
====

Name: Goblinous trolog

Physical:  Trolls are sinewy, large omnivores with green skin
and black porcine hair growing all over their body. They also
tend to have many warts covering their scale like skin. Trolls
are the largest race yet discovered, and have enormous strength.
They also tend to have a nasty disposition and must be chopped
into little bits before they will be kind enough to die. Trolls
are extremely sensitive to light, being blinded under even weak
sunlight. Trolls heal rather fast, and are immune to almost all
diseases.

Mental: This category does not really apply to trolls. Let's just
say their big, dumb, and will bash you if you say anything too
intellectual. The use of magic never really crossed the few
thoughts they have.

Culture: Trolls are a clannish lot, preferring to converse only
with their own kind. They do not appear on a general who list,
and have a hard time communicating with hominid races.

Attributes: Trolls are extremely dumb, being unable to wield any
complicated weapon. They are very adept with blunt weapons however,
and are much stronger than any other race. Trolls large size
prevents them from wearing most body armour, but their naturally
scaly skin acts as armour for them. Trolls have voracious appetites
and will eat almost anything they can fit in their mouths. Trolls
have even been observed to devour corpses of slain victims during
a fight.

Stats:	Max. HP: 570
	Max. SP: 151
	Max. FP: 510

How many trolls to change a light bulb: None. They smash
all the light bulbs they see!

NOTE:  A troll with maxed stats is considered rather collossic,
rather pumped, rather clumsy and stupid.
