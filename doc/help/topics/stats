There are four stats that describe your physical existence.

 STRength     - your strength, how hard you hit etc.
 DEXterity    - your dexterity, agility.
 CONstitution - your body health, endurance, resistance.
 INTelligence - IQ, ability to count and to spell.

The descriptions, in order from worst to best are:

 STR: scrawny, undeveloped, puny, weak, muscled, strong, giant-like,
      titan-like, collosic, titanic
 DEX: sloth-like, unresponsive, slow, clumsy, agile, dextrous, fast, quick,
      nimble, rapid
 CON: meek, sickly, unhealthy, frail, healthy, vigorous, resistant,
      invigorated, pumped, buff
 INT: peonic, moronic, stupid, dumb, smart, clever, intelligent,
      ingenious, visionary, omniscient

Some evil magic spells and attacks might drain your abilities, but
in such cases there are ways to restore them (expensive and difficult,
but possible).
