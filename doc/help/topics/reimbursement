Usually players' scores (stats and experience points and such) are not
reimbursed.

However, if your savefile is lost in mud- or system crash (this means that
your character has completely disappeared), you will get your old scores back
from the backup. This might mean loss of what you have gained during the latest
login session.

If you die clearly because of a bug, and the (co)admins also think it was the
bug that killed you, you will be reimbursed.

IMPORTANT: Dying because of netlag is not valid reason for reimbursement. There
is absolutely no way we can confirm these accidents took place.

In any case you feel you should be reimbursed contact the (co)admins, either
by telling or by mail at the post office.

ALSO NOTICE: Because of technical reasons it is imperative that you contact
the (co)admins immediately after loss of your character if crashes occur.
This way you guarantee that you will get the refreshest possible backup.
