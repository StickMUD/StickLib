Well, as you know, one aim in the game might be making you the most feared
fighter or mage ever been (although, many players seem to think making you
look like a complete moron is their aim... to each for his/her own).

To compare with other people, you have the "score". It shows some of your
attributes in a numerical form, others with a verbal description.

HIT POINTS describe your physical condition. More you have, in better
condition you are. When they go below zero, you die.

SPELL POINTS describe your "mental ability". More you have, more spells you
can cast, for example. However, even though they are named "spell points",
more accurate would be "mental points"; spell points are used for things
that need concentration as well as spell casting.

FATIGUE POINTS describe your level of physical "fitness"; actions you can
do and so on. If you don't have fatigue points, you can't do much anything.
However, current system doesn't (yet) use fatigue points for every
physical action; some guild skills do, and in future, most actions
that require physical work, will use FPs.

Hit, spell and fatigue points heal slowly towards your maximum values.
You can speed up the healing by a spell or for example a healing potion etc.
There are also certain magical items that will speed healing up.
Also, different races heal different points faster/slower. Elves heal
SPs very fast while trolls heal HPs. And hobbits are generally fastest
regenerating race.

EXPERIENCE POINTS and LEVEL describe your progress in your studies and skills.
More you have, more "experienced" you are, more you know and can. Level can
be risen when you have gained enough experience, and have enough
QUEST POINTS. You can earn quest points by doing certain quests; quests
are listed on adventurer's guild and Lords' guild.
