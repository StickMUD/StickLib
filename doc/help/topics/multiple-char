NAME
	multiple-char

DESCRIPTION
	Currently:

Multiple characters, ie having several mud-characters, is only allowed
if the following rules are followed:

1) The characters are registered. This is done by mailing to 'Mchars' and
   stating who your primary character is, and what secondary characters you
   wish to have. Also include a brief explanation why you want to have these
   other characters. The secondary characters can only be used after you have
   been informed that they have been approved.

2) You do NOT play secondary characters before you have been told that they
   are registered. You are allowed to create that character, but not to play.

3) The characters are never at the same time in the game, not even link dead.

4) The characters never interact with each other. For instance one may not
   leave money or equipment for the other characters to pick up etc.

5) Multiple chars also need to have the correct e-mail address, OR,
   they can have "mchar of X" - where X is your primary character.

Abusive use of multiple characters will result in removal of all the secondary
characters and a penalty to the main character according to the offence.
