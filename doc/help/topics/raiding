Since I plan to be doing a bit more raiding in the future,
I just wanted to make some comments on what you all can
expect from me and what I will sort of be expecting. 

So, here is Germ's rules for honourable raiding:

1)  Don't raid unless there are sufficient defenders around.
This is a subjective call...I usually won't raid unless
there is at least a lvl 30 defender or higher.

2)  Don't steal equipment from players who were killed in
a raid.  If necessary, help them retrieve their stuff, or
allow them safe passage to get it themselves.  Coins shoul
be an exception, since it is easy to deposit before the raid.
Also, I'd not be surprised to lose any uniques that I had.

3)  Don't attack non-lords unless they attack you first.
If you are a non-lord, dont attack a raider or raid unless you
dont mind dying, because you probably will!

4)  The element of surprise is important, so I usually raid without
any warning.  But when you realize that you are being raided, warn your
guild so those that don't participate can leave before they die.

5)  The raid should be confined to the general vicinity of the guild.
Once a player leaves the guild area, they should be
free to heal unmolested.  Likewise, any lords in the area
are considered to be defending and are fair game.

6)  I do not use wands while raiding or defending.  I'd also
consider it nasty to have my stats drained or suffer some
other permanent type of injury (death excepted).
Potions, however, are fine and even necessary.

Finally, if I kill you while raiding, I do not hate you and
I am not your enemy.  Similarly, if you kill me honorably while I am raiding,
I will not be angry with you.

Raiding is fun!  I think everyone should raid more, it
adds alot to the game.

Adios, see you in the raids! =-)
