Diseases are quite rare, but when they strike, the epidemics can wipe out
two thirds of the population.

Elves are immune to disease, but there are rumors of diseases which can
affect even them.

In addition to the Plague and Leprosy, known diseases include Cholera,
Brain Rot, Bowel Rot, Madness, Cramp Fever and the Fire of Holy Antonius.

Treatment is available, for the wealthy, at Tristeza Sanatorium.
