To create new help entry:

 1) Choose it's class. General commands should go to commands/ subdir (for
    example: "who"). General topics to topics/ (for example: "races").
    Miscellanous stuff to bonus/ (for example: "sauna").

 2) If it's a command, be sure to follow the format used in other command
    help entries. Topics and other information do not need to be formatted.

 3) If it was a general command or a topic, update /doc/help/index file too
    if needed.
