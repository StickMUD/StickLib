NAME
	light - light a light source

SYNTAX
	light <item name>

DESCRIPTION
	This command simply lights a light source. For simplicity, you
	don't need matches to light a torch etc.

	Note that some areas are so dark that you need many light sources -
	bring your friends or carry many lights yourself (magical and
	normal). Twilight and such are not yet operative...it's either
	dark or not.
