COMMAND
	cost - show stat and level costs

DESCRIPTION
	This command is equal to the one that can be used in
	Adventurers' Guild and Lords' Guilds - in fact, it
	is exactly the same command.

	It shows how much experience and, possibly, quest points,
	you need for the next level.

	Also it shows how much experience it costs to advance
	stats, and how much experience you can spend for the stats.

SEE ALSO
	score
