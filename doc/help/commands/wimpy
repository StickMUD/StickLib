NAME
	wimpy <percent>

DESCRIPTION
	Set a wimpy mode. If you are in wimpy mode, your legs will run
	away if your hit points go below <percent>% of the maximum
	condition.

	Percent can vary from 0 to 70.

	This is no life-proof. It might save you, if you have slow connection
	or slow fingers. Some monsters hack away more than 70% of your hit-
	points, and you might find yourself dead without warning. And some
	monsters run as fast as your legs.

SEE ALSO
	brave, flee, kill, stop, report, brief, score
