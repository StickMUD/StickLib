NAME
	clothes - list your clothes, or someone else's

SYNOPSIS
	clothes [name]

DESCRIPTION
	This lists your clothes, or, if you give an argument, that creature's
	clothes. Use 'eq' and 'exa' commands to see arms, and 'i' (inventory)
	command to check inventories.

	The finest clothes are made of silk, spidersilk or dragonskin.
	Also there is the legendary material called Moonsilk. Only Mr.
	Forrester, the Royal Tailor, knows how it can be made (or, perhaps
	he just knows where to get it from).

SEE ALSO
	inventory, eq, examine
