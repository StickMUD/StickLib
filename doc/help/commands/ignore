NAME
	ignore [name]

DESCRIPTION
	Ignore (or unignore) all tells from a player. When an ignored player
	tries to tell you something, he/she will see message "Xxx is ignoring
	you".

	- You can only ignore 10 players at the same time.
	- Ignored names are not saved when your quit.
	- Ignore blocks only tell commands (not say, shout, etc).
	- You can't ignore coders nor higher level players.
	- However, you can ignore higher _non-lords_ now
	- The ignored player will know you are ignoring him/her.

	If you are continually hampered by tells from a higher player,
	ask a high lord to help you (if you dare). If it is getting really
	nasty (like hundreds of tells per minute), you can contact a
	(co)admin.

	NEW: "ignore all", useable only by coders, however. All
	mortals will be ignored. Coders can use 'allow' command
	to allow certain people to tell them.

ARGUMENTS
	(none)  Show who you are ignoring.
	<name>  Ignore this player. If you are already ignoring him/her,
		stop ignoring.
