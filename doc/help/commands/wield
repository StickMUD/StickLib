NAME
	wield <item>

DESCRIPTION
	Wield a weapon in your hand. Helps a lot in fights.

	To unwield the weapon, type "unwield [weapon_name]".
	If you use simple "unwield", it will unwield your
	wielded weapon. You may also use "remove" instead
	of "unwield". in which case you have to specify
	the name of the weapon (since remove is used with
	armours too).
