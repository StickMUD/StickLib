NAME
	kill <who>

DESCRIPTION
	Attack a person. This starts automatic battle, so you will be hit
	back too, and you will hit yourself until either one dies or
	flees.

	You can flee by just leaving a room.

	To simply attack any monster who happens to be in a room, just
	type "kill monster". This doesn't work for all monsters though.

SEE ALSO
	stop, report, wimpy
