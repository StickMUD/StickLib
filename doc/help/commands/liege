NAME
	liege <who>

DESCRIPTION
	Choose yourself a new liege. The liege-to be needs to be in the game
	and a lord/lady. You will be follower for the liege.

	Followers of a lord/lady will have access to certain areas in their
	liege's castle. The liege and his/her followers share a common way
	of communication: the liege-follower channel "lich".

	Lords and ladies usually treat their followers well, and offer hints
	and minor equipment and such.

	You do not have to choose a liege. Many players survive very well
	without a liege.

	You can be a follower of any lord (who is of a level high enough
	to have followers).

ARGUMENTS
	(none)	Print your current liege.
	none	Stop serving your liege.
	<name>	Choose <name> to be your liege. Note that he/she will be
		informed and some of them do not like traitors...
