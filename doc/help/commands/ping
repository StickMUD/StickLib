NAME
	ping <player>

DESCRIPTION
        Sends an audible bell to the player given as parameter.

        This command should be used with care. Excessive pinging will
        be interpreted as harrassment and punished accordingly. So
        don't use it for spamming.

        NOTE: Coders can switch the audible bell off with the command
              setenv binmsg SELF
