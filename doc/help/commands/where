NAME
	where - try to find out where a player is

SYNOPSIS
	where [whom]

ARGUMENTS
	[whom]	Name of the being to detect

DESCRIPTION
	This command might show you the location of a player, or, if you
	are a high level lord, list of all players you can detect.

	You have to be at least 10th level to use this command, since
	non-lords can possibly detect only those players whose level is
	10 levels less.

	This command requires deep concentration and
	30 spell points, plus some more points, depending on who
	are you trying to 'where'.
