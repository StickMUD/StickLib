NAME
        tell <whom> <what>
        tell last [#]

        retell <whom>

        reply <what>

DESCRIPTION
	Telepate a message to a specific person. He/she/it can be anywhere
	in the game.

        'tells' is now 'tell last', but 'tell last' shows now maximum 20
        previous "tell"s sent to you.

        'retell' is like tell, but tells the previous tell you gave to
        someone else. This especially very useful if name typed wrong, or
        one wants to tell someone else the same message.

        'reply' tells <what> to the previous person that told you something.

ARGUMENTS
        <whom>  Name of the person to communicate with. This may be a list of
                names separated with commas. That way you will tell them all.
	<what>  The message to send to that person.
        [#]     How many previous tells do you want shown, this is optional,
                and defaults to 10. Maximum is 20.

EXAMPLES
        'tell doomdark Hi!'     - Doomdark gets: Alcal tells you: Hi!
        'retell mclaud'         - Mclaud gets: Alcal tells you: Hi!
        'tell last'             - Shows you the last 10 tells people told you
        'tell last 15'          -      -  "  -       15        -  "  -
        'reply Yeah..'          - If it was e.g. Mclaud who told me something
                                  he would get: Alcal tells you: Yeah..
        'tell doomdark,mclaud Atleast I don't..'
                                - Gives Doomdark and Mclaud:
                                  Alcal tells you: Atleast I don't..
