DESCRIPTION
        This command allows you to update your electronic mail address.
        This information is viewable to the rest of the mud through the
        finger command.  If you wish to keep the address private you
        need to precede the address with a "#" (i.e. #tam@foo.com).
        The admins, co-admins and arches of the mud can see the e-mail
        address of every person on the game, even those with the "#".

        Without a valid e-mail address set you cannot:
		* have multiple characters
		* become a wizard
