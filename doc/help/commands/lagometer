NAME
        lagometer - show how much StickMUD is lagging.

DESCRIPTION
	With this command you can easily check if StickMUD is really lagging
	or is it net lag (see 'help lag' for more info about different types
	of lag). The numerical values show how late every round was on the
	average. Examples: values around 0.10..0.20 are normal, around 0.60
	you notice a distinct lagging, and 1.00 means that every round lasted
	one round too long. There can be values higher than 1.00 meaning
	serious lagging.
