	set(WP_BLUNT) or set(WP_SHARP);
		If you use WP_BLUNT, it makes this a blunt (non-edged) weapon.

	set(WP_ONE_HANDED)
	set(WP_TWO_HANDED)

	set(WP_TROLL_WEAPON)	Simple weapons that trolls can use.
				Clubs etc. Do set this, they need stuff.

	set(WP_STAYS_SHARP)	This should be RARE! Mostly just uniques.

	set(WP_TROLL_1H)	Troll can wield this one-handed.
	set(WP_TROLL_2H)	Even a troll has to wield this two-handed.

	// TODO...more things are still undocumented.

	set_bluntness(x)
		Makes a sharp weapon dull. When you are placing sharp
		weapons into your area, this should be used sometimes -
		players will have to sharpen the weapon before it is
		useful.
