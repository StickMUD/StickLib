NAME
	monsters - monster balance rules

DESCRIPTION
	Technical data, numbers etc. are coming up later.
	For now, there are just guidelines:

	Experience from a monster depends on its level. Monsters
	with levels higher than 19 must have some special abilities,
	or, at the very least, larger than normal hit points.

	Monsters with best exp and/or treasure should have a breath
	or stunning attack, those are feared. Or some other neat
	surprises.

	Place the most powerful monsters far away, preferably
	behind smaller monsters blocking the way.

	Do not create much monsters with small wc and lots of
	hit points. These are too good as training dummies.

	If a monster/NPC has weapons or armor, it is best to
	keep them somewhat random. I.e. don't make monsters that
	always have items, and even better if the items are also
	sometimes different ones.
