	GUILDCODERS RULES gamma

RULES

	1. Darkelf assigns guildcoders

	2. Vetos as for promotion (see 'man promotion')

	3. If a co-admin wants to keep his guild, then he/she must fix
	   it too dammit!

GUILDCODER RULES

	Restoration of skills: if skills are lost just because of
	a bug, guild coders can restore them.

	In less obvious cases, ask an admin first.

	A character and his/her skills belong together. Skills should
	not be "moved" from one character to another!

	The only case which allows this is when a character is renamed.
	The original character that had the skills must be deleted!

UPGRADES

	NO UPGRADES! Guilds are far too good. Only downgrades
	are allowed. If there is a bug that caused an unintentional
	downgrade, that can be fixed, of course.
