	Remember the spelling when setting type, it must be EXACTLY correct.
	Those types marked with asterisk (*) are very rare!

	Type 'armour' armours generally are (from 1 to 4 AC): leather armour,
	padded/studded/ring mail, brigandine/scale mail/hide,

	chain mail/splint mail, plate mail. If it is 5 AC, it MUST be VERY
	hard to get. Those with (!) are even more scarce.

	Theoretical maximum item AC is so 23! If you DESPERATELY want another
	armour type, forget it. We have enough armour types already.

	Note about belts, rings, amulets and cloaks: only VERY RARE and
	POWERFUL magic items of these types may have an armour class.
