Topic: Privs
 
  This is a general help file to describe the file privelidge system on this
mud.  There are four things to mention when talking about the priv system:
master object, .ACCESS files, chmod command, and chown command.
 
  The master object (usually contained in /secure/master.c), has all the data
loaded in it for previously accessed directories.  Before a directory is
accessed, the master object knows nothing about the privs for that directory.
It is only when the master object sees someone try to access the directory
that it then reads the .ACCESS file.
 
  The .ACCESS file contains file priv information including, the owner,
coder level privs, and specific coder privs. An example file may look like:
 
owner:sledge
0:r
200:rw
 
:boober:r:mark:rw:jason:r:
 
The first line shows the owner of the directory. Only this coder, and the
(co)admins, can modify the .ACCESS file. The second line gives read access
to all coders with coderlevel '0' or higher. Since apprentice coders are
currently coderlevel 10, this gives read access to all coders. The third
line gives read and write access to all coders of coderlevel 200 and up.
The last line gives specific access to specific coders.
 
  The .ACCESS file should not be modified by editing it. If it is, the changes
will not be taken into effect until /secure/master.c is updated. If the
.ACCESS file is edited, and the master object is not updated, then eventually
the .ACCESS file will be overwritten with the data that was saved in the
master object.
 
  The chmod and chown commands are used to change the information in the
master object, and have it re-write the .ACCESS file. They take care of
just about everything. In other words, if you use only the chmod and chown
commands, you never really need to think about updating the master object,
or editing the .ACCESS files.
