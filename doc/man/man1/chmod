Command: chmod <coder/coderlevel> <access> <dir>
         chmod -r <dir>
 
Change access privs to the directory specified.
Generally in the form of 'chmod <group> <access> <dir>'.  The group can
either be another coder's name, or a coder level.  If you want everyone
to be able to read files, use coder level 0.  The access may be one of the
following values: 'r', 'w', 'rw', '-'.  The 'r' reffers to read access, the
'w' reffers to write access, and the '-' means no access.
 
Recursive form:  'chmod -r <dir>'
This will copy the access from the dir given, to every single sub-directory
of the specified directory.
 
Examples:
  chmod 0 r ./
  chmod kieve - ./
  chmod -r /u/kieve/
