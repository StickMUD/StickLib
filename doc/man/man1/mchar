NAME
        mchar - handle multiple character list.        

SYNOPSIS
        mchar [-acd] [char1] [char2]        

DESCRIPTION
        Command handles multiple character list. It enables viewing
        and handling the list.  

        Flags:

        none:   mchar : shows the list of multiple character groups.

        a:      mchar -a foo1 foo2 : add a new multiple character.
		If foo1 exists in the list, then foo2 is added to that
		particular character group. If not then foo1 and foo2
		form a new character group.

        c:      mchar -c foo : check if character 'foo' belongs to a
		character group. If such group is found, the members are
		shown.

        d:      mchar -d foo : delete foo from a group. If the first
		member of a group is deleted (owner of the other multiple
		characters), the whole group will be deleted. This is also
		the case if only the owner remains. Otherwise member is
		deleted and the group remains.
        
        Flags a and d are only for (Co)Admins.
