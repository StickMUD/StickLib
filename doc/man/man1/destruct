NAME
	destruct - destroy an object

SYNOPSIS
	destruct <object id or path>
	dest (synonym)

DESCRIPTION
	If there is an object named "object" in the same room, it can be
	destroyed with 'dest object'. If it is a cloned object, the original
	blue print will still remain loaded. If it is a singular object
	(not cloned), like a castle, then all data about the object will be
	discared.

	'update' command has the same effect.

	Never 'destruct' a player (you can't do it with this command).

SEE ALSO
	clone(1), update(1), load(1)
