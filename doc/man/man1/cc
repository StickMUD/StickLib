NAME
	cc - compile an object

SYNOPSIS
	cc <file>
	cc here		(compiles your environment)

DESCRIPTION
	cc compiles an object. It is done by first destructing the object,
	then calling a dummy function from it, using catch() efun to catch
	errors. Objects inside the compiled object are destroyed (except
	players).

	You can not compile cloned objects, just sources.

	Example:
	> cc obj/big_sword
	Compilation successful. No errors encountered.

	Note: If there already was clones of that big sword around, they
 	are not changed in any way.

	If cc is used to compile an object (room), the players inside
	the room are kept elsewhere during the compilation. If there
	was errors, the players can't return to their location and are
	transferred into /room/church.

BUGS
	This command is currently defined only in certain wiz-tools. It
	will be available as a /bin command later.
