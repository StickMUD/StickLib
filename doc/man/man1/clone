Command: clone
Argument: file

Clone a copy of an object. The "bluebrint" must not be used for anything
else then cloning.

If the object defined in 'file' isn't loaded, it will be. 'reset()' will
also be called in the object.

When the 'file' is loaded, a new copy of the object will be created, and moved
to either the wizard giving the command, or to his room, depending on what
'get()' says in the object. When the object is being copied, it will have
a new 'reset()' again.

Rooms and castles should never be cloned, because they should always
exist singularly, not in several copies.

NEW: You can now personalize your clone messages. Example:
setenv MCLONE $N fetches $O from another dimension.
This wouild look like: Foo fetches a bottle of beer from another dimension.
As you see, $N will be replaced with your name and $O with the object that
you clone.
