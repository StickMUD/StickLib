NAME
	load - load an object

SYNOPSIS
	load <file>

DESCRIPTION
	If the object defined in <file> isn't loaded, it will be.
	Create (or reset) will also be called in the object. If the object
	was already loaded, nothing will happen.

	Rooms can also be loaded by just walking to them. That has exactly
	the same effect.

	Example:
	> load /players/foobar/rooms/messy_room

SEE ALSO
	cc(1), clone(1)
