NAME
	conditions

DESCRIPTION

	Conditions are timed or permanent states of living beings.
	For example, C_UNCONSCIOUS means that the living is unconscious
	(how surprising!).

	Every living being has an array of conditions. Check the file
	/obj/conditions.h (and include it if you need it).

	Note: even though non-players have the conditions, they are NOT
	using 'em because it is too time-consuming. So, for now, you can't
	make a monster subject to any condition.

	When a condition is -1, it is permanent. At zero, of course,
	that condition isn't set. If the condition is higher than 0,
	it is a timed one: it is reduced at every 5th heart beat
	(once per minute of game time).

FUNCTIONS

	These functions in /obj/living.c handle the conditions:

		query_condition(no_of_condition)

	Returns the value of the condition.

		set_condition(no_of_condition, value)

	Sets condition into value.

		query_conditions()

	Returns the whole array of the being's conditions.
