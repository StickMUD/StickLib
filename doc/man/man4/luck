NAME
	luck

NOTE
	Luck is one of the things that mortals should never know anything
	about! Don't tell them anything about luck!

DESCRIPTION
	Functions in a living object which handle luck. Luck can be used
	in situations which need luck; it is already used in combat and
	some other places.

int query_random_luck()
	Returns a random luck adjustment for this living. It is based on
	luck and temp_luck, but checked randomly. Luck adjustment can
	range from -20 to +20. Usually it is zero.

void set_luck(int x)
int query_luck()
	Permanent luck. Ask a co-admin or an admin if you wish to change
	player's permanent luck somewhere. Neither an increase nor a
	decrease to permanent luck should be easy to get. Currently just
	killing another player decreases permanent luck, and death
	moves it towards zero.

int query_temp_luck()
void set_temp_luck(int x)
	Temporary bonuses or penalties to player's luck score.
	Much easier to obtain than permanent luck bonuses/penalties.
	Temporary luck is cleared when one quits. Link death does
	not clear it.

int query_item_luck()
void add_item_luck(int x)
	Add bonuses or penalties for lucky/unlucky items that player
	carries. Note, that the item itself has to take care that
	the same value is removed when the item is dropped.
	Lucky items should be very rare.
