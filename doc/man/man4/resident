NAME
	resident - room resident monsters and objects

DESCRIPTION

	/room/room.c has functions

	add_monster(string filename, string appearmsg, int reseting)
  and	add_object(string filename, string appearmsg, int reseting)

	Call this function in your create_room() to make a room resident
	monster or object. appearmsg should be given like room long descs are
	now, without any linefeeds in the string. You don't have to give
	any appearmsg, 

EXAMPLES

	You want an orc which appears again at reset if killed:

		add_monster("players/kwagga/mons/orc", "Orc arrives.", 1);

	You want a dragon which doesn't come back when killed:

		add_monster("players/foo/mons/dragon",
			"A huge red dragon lands into the room.", 0);

	A sword which doesn't reset:

		add_object("players/kwagga/obj/sword");

	A resetting ball without appearing message

		add_object("players/foo/obj/ball", 0, 1);

	Some magic effect later wants to make the dragon or sword appear again
	at resets? Then you just call the above function again, with the
	exactly same file name argument, but change that last argument to 1
	instead of 0.

	Room also has functions query_room_monsters(), set_room_monsters(),
	query_room_objects() and set_room_objects() for low level usage. Use
	these to debug and examine the resident system - and perhaps for
	something really neat if you know what you are doing.
