I suggest we make a system where each weapon's so-called
'base weapon class' is affected by wielder's strength and dexterity.
Actually, even now, normal attacks add some bonus to damage, depending
on wielder's dexterity (but not strength. odd?). Anyway, I suggest
that relative importance of strength and dexterity should vary
between different weapon types. Values I suggest (just so that others
can comment; they are just suggestions so far) are:
(btw, do comment if you think there should be some other weapon types
as well; these were the main types I remembered when writing this doc)

				STR	DEX

o Swords:
	- 1-handed		30	70
	- 2-handed		50	50
o Daggers:
	(all 1-handed)		20	80
o Knives:
	(all 1-handed)		25	75
o Clubs:
	- 1-handed		80	20
	- 2-handed		90	10
o Maces:
	- 1-handed		65	35
	- 2-handed		80	20
o Spears:
	- 1-handed		40	60
	- 2-handed		60	40
[ Bows: ]
[	(all 2-handed)		10	90]
o Dusters:
	(all 1-handed)		60	40
o Staves:
	(both 1- & 2-handed)	60	40
o Scythes:
	(both)			70	30


So. Why these modifiers and how would the affect the wc, then?

I suggest we use formula:

actual_wc = (str_fct * (20 + w_str) + dex_fct * (20 + w_dex)) * base_wc / 3500

Before explaining why & how this would work, let's take some examples:

a troll, with dex of 10 and str of 35, wields a 2-h club with base wc
of 15:

actual_wc = (90 * (20 + 35) + 10 * (20 + 10)) * 15 / 3500
	= 22.5

The same troll, then wields a 1-handed sword, of which base wc is 16:

actual_wc = (30 * (20 + 35) + 70 * (20 + 10)) * 15 / 3500
	= 16

So, what is different from current situation, is that the troll
_should_ use the club, though it's base wc (actually, the value we
now consider 'real' wc), is 15 where as sword's base wc is 16.
Why? Well, the club relies more on strenght (when doing damage);
and as trolls generally have better strength than dexterity, club
is the natural choice for them. Other suitable weapons would be
maces and 2-handed swords and dusters.

On the other hand, hobbits probably should prefer daggers or
1-handed swords (like elves).

The formula is actually a rather simple one; it just does weighting
for the base wc. The reason for modifiers 20 (added to dex & str)
and divider (3500 = 100 * 70) is as follows:

- IMHO, with max. stats, the actual wc should be about double the
  base wc (wc 25 weapon would have actual wc of 50, if it's 'perfect
  match' for the player).
- As wc depend on stats, and newbies have poor stats at first, we need
  to modify the formula so that newbies still have some reasonable
  actual wc; thus, 20 is added to the stats first. So, the scale
  is from 20 to 70 in both stats. In effect, this means that with
  stats of 15, players have the same actual wc as base wc (of course,
  depending on weapon type, one can have lower/higher values, but with
  both stats at 15, actual_wc == base_wc nevertheless).
- Range between a player with all stats at 1 and a player that
  has either str or dex at max and has a suitable weapon (a troll
  wielding a 2-handed club, say), is 60% <-> 200%. So. Players will
  have actual wcs between 60% and 200% of the base wc.
