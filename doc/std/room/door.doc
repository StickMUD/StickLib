NAME
	door

DESCRIPTION
	Just a quick door document for easy reference.
	I hope this code is correct! I didn't test it :)

EXAMPLE CODE

#include <door_defs.h>

// .... then, in create_room() function ...

  add_object( ({ DOOR_FILE,
     ({ "add_door",
        "This is a massive oak door.",	// Long desc of door
	"east",				// To which direction?
	MY_DIR + "dragons_lair",	// What room on other side?
	"rusty",			// What kind of lock?
	"arglebargle",			// Key "code"
	1,		// Closed at the start? (1 yes, 0 no)
	0,		// Locked at the start? (1 yes, 0 no)
	1,		// Is this door lockable at all?
	100,		// Pick difficulty (100 pretty hard, 20 easy)
	"It's a rusty, crude lock."	// Lock description.
     }) }), 0, 0);


// You got to add a similar door to the other side too!
// Even if the players always walk into the area from this side,
// you still have to. Since there are "teleport to" commands,
// anything _can_ happen!

// It must of course have direction "west" and room on the
// other side must be this room.
