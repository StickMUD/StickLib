	Why New Stats?
	==============

When Stickmud got races (-92?), idea was that all races could get
stats to max (20 for non-lords, 30 for lords), but some races
would have to pay more for certain stats (trolls for int etc.).
Nowadays, when cost of stat advancing is relatively small
at high levels, it doesn't really make much difference if
raising costs double the amount for a race; you can raise
all stats from 1 to 30 still using less exp than you would
need for advancing your level from 30 to 31 for example.

So, in a way, stat-wise, all races are nearly equal. What has been
done to stress diffent properties of races (stupid trolls,
weak elves etc.) so far? Well, we have dozens of race-modifiers
(called race stats), that are used when determining certain
things (like max. hp amount of player etc). In effect, troll
having int of 30 is considered to be dumber than human with
int of 20 for example. Now, while this is one way to make races
different, it's bit too complex. Why should every piece of code
have to consider both race and stat value? Wouldn't it be
_much_ simpler if all stats were "equal", so that troll with
int 20 would be as bright as elf with int 20? Answer is...
Sure. And that's what we'll be doing. However, we still have
to solve problem of racial basic properties. I suggest we do
this by making races have different stat maxes.

Another reason for New Stats is to give high level players
something to aim for. Nowadays, anyone can get stat maxes
at level 30 (or something like that?); after that, it's all
just getting new levels (and perhaps skills). If we add new
restrictions for stats, but _also giving new stat levels_,
players should have more to look for at high levels as well
as lower levels.


	New Stats - Fine... But How?
	============================

I suggest we give back exp players have used for stats under
the old system, and make them raise them manually as they wish.
This way, we don't have to make complex stat-transforming code
to consider all limitations new system has, or previous stat
levels. Simply calculate exp, and add it to player's total exp
amount. Then put all stats to level 1.


	What Would Be Max Stats Under New Stat System?
	==============================================

I think we should still try to aim for compatibility; some old
code may check that player has to have int 20 minimum to be
able to do something and so on. So... Scale should perhaps
remain as it is now. However, I'd say we should extend scale
so that maximum stats could go over 30 for some stats; although
some other stat max(es) for a given race could go below 30
(for trolls, max. int shouldn't be 30, but something lower...
see table later on this doc file).

Basically, maximum stat value for any race & stat should IMHO
be 50. Also, players can boost it with certain items... Thus
making max. value in practice something like 60 (?). Anyway,
this max. value would be rare; average max amount of stats
for races should be close to 35 (meaning that if stat max
for int for race is 45, some other stat max(es) need to be
below 35... perhaps con max should be 30 adn so on).
Note however that sum of max stats. don't have to be same
for all races; although it would make stats balanced,
this is difficult to be achieved as some stats simply are
more important than others... And also, stats are just
one part of race balance (heal rate & special abilities
should count too).

As just explaining things won't help much, let's take a look
at a table that summarizes my suggestion for max. stats of
each race:


	Stat:	STR	CON	DEX	INT	FAT
Race: ------------------------------------------------

Dwarf		40	35	25	25	50
Elf		30	25/20	40	50	25
H-Orc		40	40	30	30/25	40
Hobbit		25	25	50	40/35	30
Human		35	30	35	40	35
Lich(*)		30	30	40	45	30
Troll		50	50	20	15	40


[Note the new race, here called 'lich'. It's just a suggestion
for new undead (evil?) race; ideal spell-caster race...]
[Also note that secondary values are used in few places to
indicate that this stat max might be used instead of primary one]

	And How About Advancing Stats?
	==============================

IMHO, players should either get stats by advancing level, or
be restricted so that they could only raise stats to some
stat level relative to their player level. In effect, I suggest
that max. stat player can have on level x should be:

max_xxx_for_level = player_level * max_xxx / 50.
(where xxx = str, dex, con, int or fat)
(and of course, checking that abs. max. for given stat is
less than or equal to result)

So, a troll could raise its str to 25 on level 25, while an elf
could only raise it to 13...

Now; this system might be bit too inflexible to begin with, so
I suggest adjusting player level on this formula by +5, thus:

max_xxx_for_level = (player_level + 5) * max_xxx / 50.

This would mean that a troll on level 25 could raise its
str to 30, and elf to 15.


	What Would Be Cost Of Advancing A Stat?
	=======================================

IMHO, we should first calculate 'absolute level' of the stat in
question, like:

abs_stat_level = new_stat_level * 50 / max_stat_level.

This would mean that str 20 of a troll would become 20 (max str for
trolls being 50), whereas str 20 of an elf would become 33 (max str
for elves being 30)

After that, we could simply calculate cost without worrying about
the race; a simple formula for cost might be something like:

abs. stat <= 20:	cost = 12.5 * abs_stat * abs_stat * abs_stat
abs. stat 21-30:	cost = 800 * (abs_stat - 15) ^ 3
abs. stat 31-50:	cost = 27000 * (abs_stat - 20) ^ 2

This would make costs like:

		+  Cost:
Abs. stat:	+
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	1->2	+  0.1K
	->5	+  1.5K
	->10	+  12.5K
	->15	+  42.2K
	->20	+  100K
	->25	+  800K
	->30	+  2.7M
	->35	+  6.1M
	->40	+  10.8M
	->45	+  15.2M
	->50	+  24.3M


	How Much Would Be Max. SP/HP/FP For A Race?
	===========================================

Well, basically, now we could calculate max. hp/sp/fp without
having to care about race, as we'd have different max. stats. My suggestion
for HP & SP-formulas are as follows (haven't yet though about FPs):

Max_hp = 70 + Con * 10	(Was: 52 + Con * race_modifier)
Max_sp = 20 + Int * 8	(Was: 52 + Int * race_modifier)

Reason base values are changed (52 to 70/20) is that I think that
when a player begins his/her adventuring, he should be relatively
more capable of sustaining damage than using his/her brains... *grin*
So; bit more hps than with which players have began earlier, but
bit less sps. Also, this prevents trolls from getting too many SPs
even if the raised int to max... =)

So, amount of max. hp/sp races could get is like this
(if we use max. stat values from the earlier table):

		max_hp (was)	max_sp (was)
Race: ------------------------------------------------

Dwarf		420 (341)	220 (219)
Elf		320 (252)	420 (428)
H-Orc		470 (429)	260/220 (160)
Hobbit		320 (311)	340 (282)
Human		370 (282)	340 (340)
Lich(*)		370 (-)		380 (-)
Troll		550 (518)	140 (72)



	Umm... You Mentioned Heal Rates Too?
	====================================

Yes. Although we do have racial bonuses for healing rates now,
they're rather insignificant, especially at higher levels.
My suggestions is to re-code system so that:

- Instead of interval between "heal beats" being constant 10 as
  it is now, base interval would depend on race.
- Healing and resting would make interval smaller; healing would
  shorten it by 50% and resting by 25% (ie. halve & reduce by
  a quarter amount of ticks).
- Alcohol should add amount of hp/sp/fps living gets at each
  "heal beat"; normally (without any modifiers), amount would be 1,
  but being drunk would add this by 1. Also, level bonuses would
  raise this amount, and possible heal boosts too (ring of
  regeneration etc.).

So, suggestions for base intervals for races would be:
(values are base intervals between heal beats in heart_beats;
smaller the better!)

		HP	SP	FP
Race: -----------------------------

Dwarf		8	14/12	6
Elf		12	6	16
H-Orc		8	12/14	10
Hobbit		6	8	8
Human		10	8	10
Lich(*)		12	8/6	14
Troll		10	16	101

So, what do these numbers really mean? Well, if we converted them
to values we now use, they'd be like (when drunk and resting):

6	->	6.7 hp/sp/fp
8	->	5
10	->	4
12	->	3.3
14	->	2.8
16	->	2.5

Note that we perhaps should give level bonus too; perhaps so that
it would use something like 'bonus = (level + random(25)) / 25';
this would give 1/25 hp/sp/fp bonus / level; meaning that
at level 50 would receive +2 hp/sp/fp at every heal beat;
for level 38 it would be +1 in 50% of heal beats, and +2
for another 50%... (confusing? =) ).

Note that hobbits have generally best heal rates, to compensate
their lower stat maxes. Also, I'd say this is reasonable anyway...
Hobbits are tough little buggers.. =) Also, unlike earlier,
trolls are rather slow healers; but then again, they can
devour.


	Possible Problems...
	====================

Dwarf vs. Half-Orc; these races would be very similar to each other...
How should we try to differentiate them, while still making each
better than the other in certain things (if we did use these stats,
dwarves would be better fighters due to higher fat; but h-orcs would
have higher other stats in general?)
Also, in Tolkien-books, dwarves actually are quite dextrous (excellent
smiths & miners?), and certainly a bit brighter than half-orcs.
In my stat table, dwarves, however, are better fighters, due to
higher fatigue max (btw; not sure how changing fatigue succeeds as
fatigue is currently only used by fighters... and they have their
odd special fp-heal things too).

Hobbits: Their stat maxes are quite low. But let's face it; small
furry creatures weren't made as fighters... To compensate for relatively
low stat maxes, I'd suggest we give them best heal rates. But will
that be enough? Hobbits should be good for thieves; as their max. int
is relatively high, they might make decent mages too? But is that
really so? In Lord of the Rings, hobbits weren't that bright...
But high heal rate is ok; they did survive rather well. =)

Elves: In the table, elves' str & con have been raised a bit; IMHO,
elves should be stronger than hobbits. I think that we shouldn't, however,
raise sp max.; considering how much damage mages/priests can now do,
giving them even more sp might hurt balance?

Trolls: They get more hps; and more sps too. Could this cause problems?
