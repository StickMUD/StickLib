Set-functions of standard monster object (that you should use
with "#include <npc.h>" as 1st line of your monster's code).

Almost all functions start with "set_", the major exception
being function 'set()', of course.

Standard monster object consists of few different files; the
main file is "/lib/npc"; others, mostly for special group and
equipped monsters are there too. These are separated from basic
npc to save space. If your npc doesn't need equipment or group,
you need just the basic npc.
