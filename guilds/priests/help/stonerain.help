Stonerain (target)
==================
 Level: 25       Cost: 40 

Not only is the power of earth brought forth, it is first melded into a much
more devastating form. In this spell, the rocks take forms from tiny pebbles
to huge boulders that fly and crash into the target, mauling him and making
his day a generally bad one. Due to the extra effort needed to form the
earth power into the desired state, more effort is required for this spell
than by for example sandstorm.
