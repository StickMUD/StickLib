Boccob is the god of neutrality, magic and arcane knowledge, but he isn't
very interested in having followers. His two sons, Caine and Seth, have
gathered a large group of followers around them, and most priests serving
Boccob are actually followers of his sons. 

Caine is the demi-god of spirits and invisible forces. He is relatively
uncaring, allowing mortals to do as they wish, good or evil.
 
Seth is the demi-god of nature and life. He tries to teach his followers
to take care of everything living, and heal rather than destroy.
