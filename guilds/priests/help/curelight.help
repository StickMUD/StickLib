The simplest of healing spells, this spell is able to heal many minor wounds,
such as small cuts and bruises. It is commonly taught to young priests, due
to its simple nature and ease of casting. Many priests teach this spell to
young pupils to see how well they can handle healing magic in order to see
who they wish to take in and teach their many lessons of higher magic.
