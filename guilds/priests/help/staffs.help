Staffs
======
When you are experienced enough, you can beseech Boccob for a staff in
the inner sanctum of the cathedral. If He grants you the staff, you can
ask guild's carpenter to make it for you. Once you have got your staff,
you will receive it immediately when you beseech for it again, unless
you break your staff, when you have to ask carpenter to make a new one for
you.
