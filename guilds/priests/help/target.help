target [-delete|-clear] <name>
==============================
Without arguments adds a name on your auto-target list. Once added to that
list, you will automatically attack that target if you do not specify a target
for attack command. With optional argument '-delete' you can delete a name
from your auto-target list, and '-clear' clears the whole list.
