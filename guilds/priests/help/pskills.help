Pskills
=======
Shows your priest skills and some other information. Spells don't have any
specific skills, but they use different combinations of these. It should be
quite clear, what skills a certain spell uses, if the spell deals with
natural forces, it uses the "Knowledge of Nature" skill, if it is a healing
spell, it uses mainly "Knowledge of Life" etc.
