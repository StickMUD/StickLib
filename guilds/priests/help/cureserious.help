Cureserious (target)
====================
 Level: 15       Cost: 40

Light wounds are usually cured by the simplest of healing magic, but not all
wounds are light. If this is the case, a slightly more powerful spell may be
needed. This spell can heal medium cuts, bruises, and even mend small breaks
in bones. While not able to cure immediately life-threatening wounds, this
spell can be made to make do in many situations.
