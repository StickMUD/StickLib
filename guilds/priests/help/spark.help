Spark (target)
==============
 Level: 1        Cost: 10

The most basic of the attack spells which draw on the element of fire, is the
spell Spark. On command, fiery but small sparks of fire appear and direct
themselves at the desired target. While it may not be as powerful as some of
the other incantations of fire, it can be cast with ease, requiring a mere
thought.
