Rid <staff>
===========
If you decide that you don't need your staff for a while, you can get rid
of it by using this command. <staff> is either "staff" or "stick", depending
on which one you have. Another possibility is to 'leave' your staff on
the ground, but if you use "rid" command, you don't have to come back and
pick it up, but you can beseech it back from Boccob.
