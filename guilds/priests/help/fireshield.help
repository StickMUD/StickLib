Fireshield (amount of sps)
==========================
 Level: 35       Cost: 45 

Fireshield is the more powerful version of the might shielding prayer. It
will not only protect you from damage, it will also zap the attacker back
with might force. However, you have to load your shield with your mental
power to have it actually do any damage. It will also give you extra
protection against intense heat and cold. Maximum amount of spell points
you can store at the time is 100.
