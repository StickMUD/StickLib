Sandstorm (target)
==================
 Level: 15       Cost: 25

By tapping into the plane of earth, a small storm producing sand is formed
that swirls around the target. The sand can scratch and wound the target
quite badly. Despite its name, this spell can hit only one target at once,
but it doesn't take much effort to cast this relatively simple, but very
potent spell.
