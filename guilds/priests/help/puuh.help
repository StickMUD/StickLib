 Puuh
 ====

 Puuh (phew-uuh):

 A sound best described as something between a 'phew' and a
 'bleah'. Best generated by taking a deep breath and letting
 it out slowly, but changing your mind in the middle and just
 phewing it all out at once while looking very frustrated.

 A divine PUUH is always to be taken seriously. Idle puuhing
 is considered blasphemy and will be severely punished.
