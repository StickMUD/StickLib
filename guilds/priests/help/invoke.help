Invoke <spell> <arguments>
==========================
Invoke a spell at given target. Actually priests should use prayers rather
than spells, but priests of Boccob have traditionally used spells.
You don't have to type the whole name of the spell you want to use, just
a couple of letters from the beginning is sufficent, like when mixing
potions.
