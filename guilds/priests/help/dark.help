 Level: 2        Cost: 5

While most depend on the light of day in order to be able to conduct their
every day activities, there are some who shun the light, either for reasons of
necessity, or preference. By chanting a few words, they can bring forth a
sphere of darkness that surrounds them. The more powerful the caster, the more
enveloping the darkness they bring forth.
