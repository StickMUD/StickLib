Martial arts
============
This skill turns your hands into lethal weapons. The better your skill
is, the more damage you will make and more critical hits will occur. This
skill is also a mastery skill for several other skills.

Iron palm
=========
This skill allows you to inflict damage using your hand and feet. After
long and hard work a monk can deal crushing blows without feeling pain.
Your skill and martial arts affect the damage greatly.

Dim mak
=======
Dim mak is a secret martial arts skill. Only the most advanced monks can
use this skill, and only the truly best know its power. This skill can
only be used to start the combat, as it is very hard to perform. The power
of this skill great: a mere handshake can be deadly to an opponent, let
alone a touch to an earlobe.

Contact reflexes
================
This skill allows the monk to lessen the effect of great amouts of damage
by using his own body to lessen the impact or dodging the blow.

Kick
====
This skill allows you to deliver damage to opponents with your feet. The
amount of damage caused depends on your strength and dexterity. Kick is
also used to determine Iron palm damage.

Ki
==
Ki is one's inner strength. Learning this skill teaches its applications.
You can concentrate this strength in two ways. One is to improve the power
in your blows and the other is to improve your endurance.

Stun
====
This skill helps you to score 'stun criticals' in battle. With better
skill you will stun more and the stuns will be longer. It is automatically 
in effect all the time you are fighting.

Flaming fists
=============
This spell allows you to create flames around your fists, which cause
extra damage in melee combat.

Quicksilver
===========
This spell can be used to improve your or someone elses dexterity
momentarily. 

Heal self
=========
This is a simple spell, which can be used to heal your own wounds. It
will not refresh you though.
