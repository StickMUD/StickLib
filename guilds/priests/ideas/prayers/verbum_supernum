Verbum Supernum (The Word of God)

Verbum Supernum was written by St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) in honor
of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament. In addition to Verbum Supernum, St.
Thomas also wrote Adoro Te Devote, Lauda Sion, Pange Lingua, and Sacris
Solemniis at the specific request of Pope Urban IV (1261-1264) for the
then newly instituted Feast of Corpus Christi in 1264. It is used as a
hymn at Lauds (Morning Prayer) on Corpus Christi. The last two stanzas
are the text for the hymn O Salutaris Hostia.

Verbum supernum prodiens,
Nec Patris linquens dexteram,
Ad opus suum exiens,
Venit ad vitae vesperam.

In mortem a discipulo
Suis tradendus aemulis,
Prius in vitae ferculo
Se tradidit discipulis.

Quibus sub bina specie
Carnem dedit et sanguinem;
Ut duplicis substantiae
Totum cibaret hominem.

Se nascens dedit socium,
Convescens in edulium,
Se moriens in pretium,
Se regnans dat in praemium.

O salutaris hostia,
Quae caeli pandis ostium,
Bella premunt hostilia;
Da robur, fer auxilium.

Uni trinoque Domino
Sit sempiterna gloria:
Qui vitam sine termino
Nobis donet in patria. Amen.



The Word of God proceeding forth,
Yet not leaving the Father's side,
Went forth upon His work on earth
And reached at length life's eventide.

By false disciple to be given
To foemen for His Blood athirst,
Himself, the living Bread from heaven,
He gave to His disciples first.

To them He gave, in twofold kind,
His very Flesh, His very Blood:
Of twofold substance are we made,
And He would freely be our Food.

By birth our fellowman was He,
Our Food while seated at the board;
He died, our ransomer to be;
He ever reigns, our great reward.

O saving Victim, opening wide
The gate of heaven to all us below:
Our foes press on from every side;
Your aid supply, Your strength bestow.

To Your great Name be endless praise,
Immortal Godhead, One in Three!
O grant us endless length of days
With You in our true country. Amen.
