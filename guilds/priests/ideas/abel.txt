Abel was the second son of Boccob. He was the responsible one of the 
brothers, helping his little brother and trying to keep Caine away from
trouble. However, he thought only purity wasn't enough. He wanted to be
both pure and powerful, so he did his best to maintain the balance of
these powers. Boccob was very proud of him, Abel had grown to be much
like his father, wise and patient, still strong when the needed.
