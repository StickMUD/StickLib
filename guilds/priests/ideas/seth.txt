Seth is the youngest son of Boccob. From his early days he was one with the 
Nature. He played with the pigeons, his laugh was like a thousand little 
bells. His older brother Caine tried to corrupt him with his ideas, but
Seth stayed strong with his beliefs. Even nowadays, Seth is the Demigod of
Healing and Mercy, and his healing powers are known throughout the realms,
spreading the word of Boccob with his priests.
