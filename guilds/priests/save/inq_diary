Today, I was chosen to be the new Inquisitor of the Holy Order. As I sat down
and opened the book, I noticed the former Inquisitor had used it as a notebook.
For me, this books is more of a Journal rather than a piece of paper where I can
write the things I need to remember. Anyhow, being an Inquisitor is new for me,
as I have never killed anyone, not even the lowliest heathen. With this I mean
no disrespect for my Deity, Caine. I just follow his lessons in my own way, doing
my best to spread the word and praise Boccob and his two holy sons.

However, it is late now, and I must close this book for now, have a drink of our
fine Ameretto, and perhaps meditate a few hours before getting some, oh so well
deserved, sleep.
