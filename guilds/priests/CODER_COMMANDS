There's special commands for coders, which should make it easier to test
the skill system etc. hmm... There seems to be quite a lot of them, maybe
I should make a separate object for these commands or make only one command
which can handle all these things. (?)

All these commands begin with "pcoder" (for example, pcoder pset all 400)

pset <skill_name> <skill_level>   - set a skill, 0 <= skill_level < 1000 
make_distillation <race> <level>  - make a distillation (level is the level
   of the monster, whose blood is in the bottle)
make_potion <potion_name> <level> - make a potion. level should be 0..100
add_officer <name> <office n>     - add a player to officer list. Office n
   is the number of the office. If it's 0, the player is removed from list.
restore_skills <name>  - restore player's skills from a backup file
update_symbols - update all symbols in the game
askills <name> - show player's alchemy skills
pskills <name> - show player's general skills
priest_list    - a list of priests, includes testchars and coders who have
   joined only temporarily, too :(
priest_info <name> - Shows some info for player, and if no arguments, for
  the whole guild.
debug <name> - Start debugging a player. Without arguments stop it. Prints
   a lot of information on skills etc on the screen, not very usefull unless
   you snoop that player too.
