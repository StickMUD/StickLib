This file is mostly meant for my own use, but if you really don't have 
anything else to do, you can try to fix the problems listed here. :P
// Chopin

- earhmeld does not train

- healing spells train even if you aren't actually healing (cast it on a
  player with full hp/fp)

- angels stay aggressive when the target player dies.

- angels don't fail when commanding them to defend you. Maybe they should
  *shrug*

- there are several rooms in the guild where you sometimes can teleport out.
  Perhaps there should be a way (but damgerous one) how raiders could
  get out.

- Angel defend does not work properly: If you type "5 angel defend" and move

- Fireshield is not working properly (does not do any damage)

- several others that I don't now remember
