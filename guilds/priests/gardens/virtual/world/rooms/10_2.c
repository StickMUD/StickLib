/*
 * MOONWELL
 *
 * Well, this isn't actually a well, but I got the idea from Ramlin,
 * and I couldn't deny that it wouldn't be a good idea to have a place
 * where priests can empty their staffs before they leave, so that precious
 * spell points wouldn't be wasted. Venom had a similar idea (Ramlin
 * had told it to him?), but he called it "manapool", so I made
 * a cross: "moonpool".
