"The absolute silence here reminds you that you are in one of the most \
sacred and holy of places. This library contains the accumulated wisdom \
and knowledge of the Holy Order which has been passed down through millenia \
uncounted by faithful scribes serving the Order. The vibrant feeling of \
power seems to eminate from the thousands of tomes lining the shelves which \
cover almost every inch of the walls. The few open spots on the walls \
reveal a rich burl-oak paneling. The soft grey wool carpeting whispers beneath \
your feet as you walk here. A large Codex sits on a stand in the center of \
the room. Many tables and chairs are available to ease your studies. A \
portrait of Anitra hangs here, wreathed in black crepe.");
