"This cluttered room eminates smells of rare herbs and strange and \
exotic tinctures. Partial covering the dark bloodwood paneling \
on the back wall is a large tapestry. Where it can be seen from \
under the alchemy table and the assorted hermetical apparati \
filling the room, the carpet is of a fine mulberry woolen. \
The only tidy spot in the room is the ornate bloodwood desk. \
On the desk sit a featherpen and ink well, several cups and \
suacers, and a large steaming teapot. The vapors from this \
seem to lighten your mood immediately. There are also \
manuscripts on the desk. A large map hangs on the wall \
above the desk. On the opposite wall the black eyes of \
the largest mounted dragonhead you have ever seen \
glitter menacingly in the diffuse light.");

bearing titles of 'The Secrets of Alchemy' and 'A Young Alchemists Life'.",
"map":"A ornately drawn map of the world. The more you look, the less \
resemblences to reality it bears. It must be kept for some other reason.",
({"table","alchemy table"}):"The top of this low table is made from \
polished granite to resist the potent elements of the alchmists art. \
The table is covered with alchemical apparati.",

containing assorted reagants, and a hand centrifuge.",
"dragonhead":"On closer inspection, you realize that the dragonhead is \
not from a dragon. It is a finely crafted mithril sculpture. The scales \
are made from flakes of some iridescent gem. It bears a small tag \
reading: 'A small token of our gratitude to you. We will be in your \
debt as long as these lives you saved for us last.' This is followed \
by the mark of a dwarven mining guild. If this head isn't real, why \
does it seem that the eyes are following you?",
"teapot":"The teapot hums merrily, although no source of heat can be \
discovered beneath it. It smells so inviting you can hardly resist the \
urge to fill one of the cups on the desk beside it.",
"tapestry":"This large tapestry is an intricately repeating pattern \
that, taken as a whole, displays the sacred Symbol of the Holy Order \
of Boccob. If you look closely, you will see that each small \
piece is also in the shape of the Symbol." ]));
