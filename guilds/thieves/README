This is the Thieves' Guild, given as it is. Note that:

1. This has not been tested with sticklib at all.
2. This does not probably work with sticklib, without fixes.
3. This is really bad code, do not take it as an example of good coding.
4. This does not use any kind of global skill system.
5. This might need a balance daemon, which might not be included, or
   works differently in sticklib.
6. The coders who made this mess are not obliged to help you with
   this guild in any way whatsoever.
7. If you want to use bad code like this, the original coders take no
   responsibility for any damages to your MUD, machine or your mental
   health caused by the Thieves' Guild.
8. The values (tune.h etc) are not exactly the same as for StickMUD.
   So: do not whine in StickMUD basing it on this code. And do your
   own tuning.

Original Thieves' Guild was coded 1990 by Graah. After that, it has been
messed up by many others too; Attila, Chaotic, Chopin, Cigam, Colt,
Doomdark, Frobozz, Kieve, Necros and many, many others I don't remember.

Guild of Thieves is freely distributable, copyright by StickMUD,
and should not be used commercially.
