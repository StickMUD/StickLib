// Modified 26-Jan-98, Kieve
//   The calculation for tumble_success() was god damned aweful.
//   I completely re-did it.  Also a few changes in the query_guild_ac_rate
//   function because of a few silly mistakes (ie unreachable code)
//   I also fixed the rate at which the damage is reduced. It was almost
//   90% every time... now it is more reasonable.
// Modified 01-Feb-98, Kieve
//   Added SOME tumble when a miss occurs just because they are dying way
//   way way too fast.
// Modified 04-Feb-98, Kieve
//   I changed the dwarf tumble train delay to be the same as a hobbit
//   Graah had made dwarves have an advantage as a thief, but could have
//   missed this one.
// 19-May-98 / Graah: query_guild_ac_rate() now checks if the hitter is
//		      living and not ourself: only if so, we can tumble.
//		      However, it is nice to be able to tumble some traps;
//		      so DT_CRUSH can still be tumbled.
