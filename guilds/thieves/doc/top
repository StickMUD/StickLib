NAME
        top
 
SYNTAX
        top <1..12>
 
        For example, 'top 1' lists the best Backstabbers.
 
DESCRIPTION
        Lists ten thieves known to be the best with a certain skill. One has
        to login and visit guild hall to (possibly) appear on a list.
 
        NEW: Demons are not on these top lists. Who wants to see ten
        "Ultimate" on every list...

	NOTE: If you feel your location on the lists is not correct,
	go into the guild hall and type 'toptencheck'.
 
        Lists:
                 1      Backstabbers
                 2      Sneak/Hiders
                 3      Throwers
                 4      Lockpickers
                 5      Stealers
                 6      Appraisers
                 7      Poisoners
                 8      Tumblers
                 9      Best Averages
                10      Best Stab Damage     (Demons only)
                11      Best Throw Damage    (Demons only)
                12      Best Steals          (Demons only)
 
        Note that the lists tell the best _skills_: the best stealer should
        actually be the person who has stolen most money. Perhaps there will
        be such lists some day.
