DESCRIPTION
	Some races are better thieves than the others.

	Hobbits have the most bonus to thief skills, the second
	best are dwarves, then elves.

	Half-dorcs have penalties to skills, and trolls have even
	more penalties.

	Now, you think, of course, that since skills train whenever
	you fail with them, you'd train much better with a half-orc
	or a troll. Wrong! Half-dorcs train quite slowly, and
	trolls train MUCH slower than any other race. No use to
	try cheating with those races any more.
