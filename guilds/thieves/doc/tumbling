NAME
	tumbling

DESCRIPTION
	The skill of tumbling works constantly. It is a technique used to
	dodge missile, melee and spell attacks. One must not be stunned or
	confused to be able to dodge. You can't usually avoid _all_ the
	damage, only some of it.

	As with other thieven skills, you will learn more from your
	failures.

	Tumbling is the most difficult skill of the guild and it takes
	extremely long to train it to ultimate levels.
