NAME
	disguise
USAGE
	disguise tattoo

	NOTE: simple "disguise" is not a thief command.

DESCRIPTION
	This command hides your thief tattoo so that other players can't
	easily see whether you are a thief or not. Note that this command
	has to have argument 'tattoo', otherwise it has a completely
	different meaning (see 'help disguise').

	To show your tattoo again, just "disguise tattoo" again.
