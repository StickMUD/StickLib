                "tth item at someone"). Costs more as you become more skilled
steal           10 sp. Steal gold or an item from someone. Note that stealing
                items is MUCH harder than stealing just money. If you type
                steal without arguments, you will automatically try to steal
                from nearest monster (not player).

pick            10 sp. Pick locks. While any door can be tried, the success is
                not certain. Costs some spell points. Note: You cannot pick
                locks without lock picks, which you must find yourself.
refresh         Type this command if there seems to be something wrong with
                your thief skills.

                new version is announced when you are in the game!
sneak           5 sp. Try to sneak around. If you manage to sneak
                successfully, your stab is much more likely to hit.
stab            10 fp. Backstab an enemy. If your sneak wasn't successful, the
                stab won't success either. Invisibility is as good as sneak.
                Can work multiple times per fight. A "stab" without arguments
                makes you automatically stab the nearest monster (be careful).
tpose           8 sp. Thief pose.
