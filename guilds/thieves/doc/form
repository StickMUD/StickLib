TOPIC
	form - the application form for joining the Guild, and
	the relevant commands

DESCRIPTION
	Now the new thief candidates need an application form
	which has to be filled before they can join.

	The form has to be signed by three different thieves,
	using command 'sign'. The syntax is 'sign form for <name>'.
	Only enforcers and higher officials can sign forms.

	Also the candidate has to be in the game for 10 hours
	before he/she can join.

	An enforcer or higher official is required to actually
	accept the candidate, using 'join' command.

	There is also a command, 'form', which can be used to
	check candidate's application form. Just type
	'form <name>'.
