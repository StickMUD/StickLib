	criticals - What are the chances of a critical success?

DESCRIPTION
	Now all chances of critical stabs, throws and tumbles have been
	recoded. They all use the same rates. Also the chances are actually
	possible to calculate by looking at the code.
 
	Chance of a simple critical success is from 1% to 20%. There is
	always a 1% chance. With non-Ultimate skills, the chances are not
	usually much over 10%.
 
	Race affects critical chance a few percents.
 
	Above Ultimate skills should now have a clear effect on the chance
	of critical success.
