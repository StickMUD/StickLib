COMMAND
	hide - Hide in a room

USAGE
	hide

DESCRIPTION
	Hiding is different from sneaking: when you hide, you go into the
	darkest shadows, or into bushes, or below a table etc. and stay
	perfectly still and quiet.

	Using any command except "examine" and "look" stops your hiding.
	There are some technical problems which must be solved before
	any other commands can be allowed.

	If you are succesfully hiding in a room, you might be able to
	surprise a foe who walks in. When you stop hiding, others will
	not see anything happening.

	There is no limit to the time you can stay hidden (except reboot
	or link death etc).

	Going hiding costs only 30 spell points at the moment. It can
	be used to train sneak skill "faster", however you will need to
	regenerate spell points in between, so it might not be much
	quicker way to train than a normal sneak.

NOTE
	Normal 'where' command does not detect a hiding thief
	any more. However, special where items and spells might
	do that.

HINT
	You can stab from hiding. Also you can keep typing "stab someone"
	etc. until such target appears. That won't stop the hiding.

P.S.
	Hide is not always successful. You of course will always
	think that it is...
