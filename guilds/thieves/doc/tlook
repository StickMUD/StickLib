NAME
	tlook
USAGE
	tlook <direction>

DESCRIPTION
	By spending 15 spell points for concentration this command needs,
	you can peek into any direction. This does not work everywhere,
	nor does it work into dark rooms (unless you happen to have infra-
	vision, in which case you may still get some information). Note
	that you will have to give the whole direction name as an argument;
	'northeast', 'south' or 'down' works but NOT 'ne', 's' or 'd'.
