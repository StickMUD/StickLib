	stab
USAGE
	stab				[Stab nearest monster]
	stab <creature>
	backstab <creature>

DESCRIPTION
	The skill of backstabbing is one of the most important of the
	Guild, if not the most important. Your target must not see you
	when you sneak behind his/her/its back, so you MUST be invisible
	or sneaking before your stab can be successful.

	Thieves can 'stab' with blunt weapons too; that means you hit
	your target in to the most vulnerable area, from behind, as hard
	as you can.

	To train stab, you must eventually begin stabbing bigger
	and bigger monsters...

NEW:	Stabbing with a poisoned weapon might cause victim to be
	poisoned - with ALL the poison the weapon has!

NEW:	Multiple stabs are possible. You must stab your victim once,
	then go hiding somewhere until your victim forgets to be
	alert. This takes from half a minute to several minutes -
	it depends on how clever your victim is. After that, you
	can go stab the victim again. You must of course sneak or
	be invisible when you do that.
