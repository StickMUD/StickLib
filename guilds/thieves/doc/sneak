NAME
	sneak
USAGE
	sneak

DESCRIPTION
	The skill of sneaking is quite important. A thief must sneak behind
	a foe unnoticed before a backstab can be attempted.

	Sneaking drains your spell points because it needs a lot of
	concentration. You can sneak only a few moments at once.

	If you are able to become invisible, you don't have to sneak any
	more. Invisibility is always counted as a successful sneak.
