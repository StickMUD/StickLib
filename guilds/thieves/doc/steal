NAME
	steal
USAGE
	steal				[Steal gold from nearest monster]
	steal <creature>		[Steal gold]
	steal <item> from <creature>

DESCRIPTION
	The skill of picking pockets is one of the most important of the
	Guild. Stealing costs 10 spell points per attempt. It helps to be
	invisible or sneaking when you try to steal, but note that your
	victim _always_ has a change to notice your steal.

	You _don't_ usually notice if the victim has noticed your attempt.

	This skill is pretty hard to train. Steal a few times from each
	monster, but not too long. You can't get very much training from
	one monster at a time.

IMPORTANT NOTE
	Using this command on other players may get you killed! That is
	the risk you willingly take. So blame yourself if you are killed
	because you stole from a player.

SEE ALSO
	sneak, stab, tth, pick, appraise

P.S.
	You can even steal wielded weapons and worn armour. Success
	might be quite rare though...
