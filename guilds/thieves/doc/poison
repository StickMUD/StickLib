  -*Poison Skill*-

   At long last thieves have learned the skill of poison.
Very simply you need:
   A jojojopo plant
   A mushroom
   A corpse
   and a poison vial (found in guild shop)
to make poison.  You can use this skill anywhere, just as 
long as you have the ingredients.  To create the poison simply
use 'brew'.  You will save it in your vial and can then 
'apply poison to <something>'.  At the moment only poisoned
weapons will do anything useful, but anything can be poisoned.
Poison can be delivered through stab and/or tth.

 *NOTE* 
  As this is a new skill it may need some changing.  Ingredients
may change, so don't be surprised if they do.  Training will be
slow due to possible shortage of vials, ingredients, etc.  Be 
aware that although it is slow, high level poisons are quite
deadly and worth the wait.  Have fun with this.
