NAME
	cant - thieve's channel

USAGE
	cant [msg], chant [msg], cant, chant

DESCRIPTION
	With cant, you can chat with all the other thieves in the game.
	Messages from channel are seen like this:

	[Thf Graah] I just robbed 500000 gold from Wolfen *strut*

	Mere 'cant' or 'chant' without arguments lists the thieves in
	the game. You won't usually see all the invisible ones though.
	The thief list may look something like this:

	Thieves in game:
			Graah		(the Thief Sovereign)	: on
	       ENFORCER Xxxxxx		(the Rogue)		: off
	  Great Stabber Yyyyyy		(the Master Thief)	: IGNORING YOU
	    GUILDMASTER Zzzzzzzz	(the Prince of Thieves) : on
			Aaaa		(the Burglar)		: off
	Total number of thieves: 5

	If you see "Lazy something" on someone's title, it means that
	that person should train that skill.

       *NEW* you can use emotes on channel.  The syntax is:
        'cant : is a fine stallion'...This would show on channel as
       [Thf] Colt is a fine stallion  .. Note the space after the :
       This allows 'cant :)' to work and other similiar type things.
