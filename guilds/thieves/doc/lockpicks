NAME
	lockpicks

DESCRIPTION
	Lockpicks do break quite often. But nothing much can be done to them,
	guild's blacksmiths make them from the best available steel and with
	their best workmanship. They make them as fast as they can, but even
	that is not enough.

    About magic lockpicks

	All magical lockpicks were made long ago, in the ancient times when
	the grass was still green and the mighty mage-thieves ruled almost
	the whole planet (Loob). Today, all those items are lost. Perhaps some
	of them may be found in the treasure hoards of some ancient monsters
	far away. One legend also tells about one lockpick which was
	accidentally dropped into Sewers.
