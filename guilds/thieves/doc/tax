NAME
        tax
 
DESCRIPTION
        This is Demons' command for setting taxes. Demons may set the base
        tax % and the tax % per level.
 
        Level tax is divided by 10 when used, so if a Demon sets tax per
        level to "3", the tax actually increases 0.3% per level.
 
        Here's an example of what the tax command may show:
 
        ---
Tax base level is currently 10%.
Tax base increases 0.3% per level of thief.
Sample tax rates:
Lvl 1:10% Lvl 6:11% Lvl 11:13% Lvl 16:14% Lvl 21:16% Lvl 26:17% Lvl 31:19% 
Use commands "tax base <x>" and "tax level <x>" to change.
        ---
 
        Enforcers may check other's taxes with command "tax list".
