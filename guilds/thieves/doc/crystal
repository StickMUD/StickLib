NAME
	crystal ball

DESCRIPTION
	In the innermost chamber of the Guild is the ancient crystal ball of
	the thief-mages. It can be used to track dangerous foes - just
	'gaze for <name>' (or even shorter 'gaze name'). Demons and
	enforcers have even more control over the ball, they can even
	track garrottes and perhaps other objects - though many of the ball's
	powers still remain a mystery.
