NAME
        garrottes
 
DESCRIPTION
        The Six Garrottes of the Guild are legendary weapons, which are
        available to all thieves. You use them to strangle a victim and
        drop them to the ground - dead. It takes a great amount of
        strength and skill to use this weapon to its fullest potential.
 
        When one is borrowed, it is the responsibility of the borrower
        to return it. If it is lost, it is up to the borrower to get it
        back, and return it to its rightful place, or suffer the
        concequences. If a garrotte is replaced, but it is not the same
        one borrowed, you will still be held responsible for returning
        your garrotte.
