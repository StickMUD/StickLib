NAME
        demon

DESCRIPTION
        Demons are demi-godly beings who have done almost everything there is
        to do and achieved ultimate thieven skills.

        They can set their pretitle on channel:
                set pretitle <something>
        and stop using any pretitle with
                set pretitle none       (or clear or 0)
        if they want to use pretitle DEMON, they can
                set pretitle 1          (or DEMON...)
        weird, isn't it?

Demon Temple

        The Temple is located below the Enforcer's room of the Guild.
        The Guardian, a Major Demon, only allows Thief-Demons to enter.
        Obsidian Altar of the Demonic Side of Skert has numerous powers.
        True Demons can read the secret inscriptions on the altar. The more
        powerful is the worshipper, the more powers will the altar give.
        Of course, nothing is free, and to get power one has to sacrifice
        something...

RULES
        Generally it is thieves and demons themselves who decide what
        demons should do. 

           At this time, Demonship shall be granted to any thief who 
           achieves an Ultimate Average.  A decision by fellow demons to
           not grant a thief his/her DEMONship can also be taken into 
           consideration.
