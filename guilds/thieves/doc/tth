NAME
        tth - Thieves' throw
USAGE
        tth <item>                      (If you already have an opponent)
        tth <item> at <creature>
 
DESCRIPTION
        With tth you can hurl small items and light weapons at your foe and
        cause good damage. The concentration needed takes 8+ spell points
        and takes a while - similar to delay with the kill command. The
        cost of tth increases as your abilities go up. The damage done to
        your victim increases also.
 
        You can tth anything, but only weapon throwing will train your skill
        level.
 
        Critical hits cause awful damage. Sometimes the poor target is also
        stunned or even knocked unconscious.
 
        You don't have to pick up the item after each throw - it is supposed
        to happen automatically. There is now a small chance your thrown
        item will not return.  Blunt items and weapons can bounce to the
        ground. At higher skill levels this also can cause extra stunning.
        Sharp weapons can stick into the enemy.  At higher skill levels
        this can be used to possibly deliver poison from a poisoned
        tth weapon and/or cause massive bleeding in the opponent which
        causes extra damage.
