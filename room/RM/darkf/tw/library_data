 "ORCS are known to be violant, ugly and quickly self-productive like rats.
 The more sophisiticated races (like human, elf, dwarf) have more than
 often been in battle with this furious and quite unintelligent
 race. Orcs are a subclass Orkhoids, belonging to prior class
 Goblinoids, usually classified under term "orcs, goblins and
 rest of the crap". This is a lot argued argument, but since
 orcs have green blood, they do fullfill most important details
 of the Goblinoid class. Orcs also have very strange rites and rituals,
 often considered violent and tasteless, as the picture a112 and a113 show."

You gaze at the pictures and start feeling sick. You decide
you already have more knownledge of orcs than you ever want to know.
