 
Sandy path winds itself forwards under the dark shadows of petrified,
age-old trees. The trees, leaning towards the path, their branches trying
to catch the innocent passers-by, trees so old they probably saw the
same morning dawn with your greatgreatgrandfather. You can't hear birds
singing in this forest, not a slightest sound nor rustle, nothing, nothing
but silence. Further to the north the darkness increases, and southwards
the path the forest seems to get thinner.
