// New standard "show"-command. With this players (and npcs too)
// can show an item to other players or npcs.
//
// Version 1.0 01-jun-95 by Doomdark
//
// This command calls function "catch_show" in player/npc to whom
// the object is shown, with 2 arguments:
// 1st: Object pointer of the player/npc who shows the object and
// 2nd: Object that is being shown. Ie:
//	"living_item_is_showed_to -> catch_show(who_shows, what_shows);"
//
// 12-30-97  Kieve -- Remove the check for showing yourself. Yes, some people
//                    Want to show things to themself.
//                    Added a catch_show() call to the object being shown.
