The files in these directories are not to be cloned! They are called to
produce the wanted effects. They are here so they can be easily modified
even while the mud is up.

All files in these directories have read and write access to the whole mud.
That is why special care has to be taken with files put into these
directories.

The following directories exist:

daemons
	Common daemons like nature (contains game clock & weather),
	random fail messages, etc.

usr
	Coder commands

pub
	Public commands, can be called by all players (and monsters)

skills (possibly)
	Skill commands
