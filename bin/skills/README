Skill commands, like

aim, bash, stab, pick, steal, sneak, rescue, swim, climb, throw,
kick, disarm, leap, ...

Bugs:

-	should some skill commands be delayed 1 beat? currently most of
	them are...

ALL skill commands could be delayed 1 round!

But this means that skill commands MUST NOT USE notify_fail()!!!
(they can use it but the message is lost.)

If we still want a skill command which is not delayed, we can
place it in /bin/pub.
