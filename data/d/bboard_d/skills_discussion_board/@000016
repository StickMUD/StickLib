I have a question.  Once a skill has been mastered and disappears off our skill list..does that mean we can no longer use it?  Also can you explain better what it means to take the skill again a learn a new way?  I mean that once a skills is mastered if we take it again then it will start from our mastery and work to a new level or what?

thanks
Haplo
