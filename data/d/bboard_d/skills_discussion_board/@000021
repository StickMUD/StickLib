Title: Dodge demystified
Name: Starks
Date: Jan 28


Some of you had questions, and they're legitimate ones.
Because of a lack of messages, you dont get appropriate feedback
as to what affects your dodge, so here's how it works:

Armour: Wear it light, or wear it not at all.
     It's difficult to move in heavy armour, and requires more effort
	This will reflect in terms of effectiveness and cost.

Dexterity: You get a small effect bonus depending on your dexterity.

Dodgeweight, and other dodge measuring commands:
Are not in my own personal queue of projects to be done.
Think of it this way, the more fp being sucked away, the more effect
your armour weight is having on your ability to dodge.
Those who wish to fight fully armoured but do not wish to incur the
fp cost may use the "dodge" command to stop dodging.
(When not dodging, it will not train)

Rationale behind the change:
	I tried sumo wrestling today with one of those sumo suits.....
if you haven't tried it, it's quite an experience.

(Well, sort of =) )

If you encounter serious problems (serious for the MUD, not you =) )
post or mail or sumfin.

(I know it's a downgrade early in this skills life, but think.....does
it make sense?)
