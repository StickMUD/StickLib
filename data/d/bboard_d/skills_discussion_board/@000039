starks,
I Figure I will give some input on the new training system 
I am the most trained as far as i know being more than
midway though the rank of talented. If training dificulty increases
with every rank well seems to be completely impossible
too achieve what i have .. I have spent about 2 -3 weeks on melee
only training about 8 hours a day. I am not asking for instant 
power I just feel that once I achieve whatever is past talented
the next rank will seem like a lifetime , which is daunting 
challenge. 

Elyic the trainer.
