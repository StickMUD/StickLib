That is cool and does sound encouraging, but maybe training difficulty could level off instead of increasingly getting more difficult.  Maybe have about 5 ranks in a row as difficult as Accomplished level...Which is still extremely slow, but at least we have some players that have passed it....It would help keep/build interest for those that are really trying hard to train new skills.
