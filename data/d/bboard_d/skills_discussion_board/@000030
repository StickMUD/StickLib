I don't know what else has been incorporated into the new skills..and maybe some of these ideas should be for more specialized skills way off..but i had a few general ideas that i have been thinking off which are mostly a compilation of stuff i've...
heard listening to ppl talk about for my life as a mudder...

First..I think it would be need to make teachers more interactive for future use rather then just learning the skills.  I know a few ppl on here suggested something along those lines, but I think maybe after rankng to guru...to master the skill or get ..
gr...or to get the next "level" of skill, maybe the teacher has you do a quest?
along those same lines, maybe there are some skills which require you complete a quest or bring the teacher some item of significance for training..or perhaps a special item needs to be made for training..e.g. archery..you might have to make a bow/arrow
as you skills get better..you may not only shoot better, but be able to go back to the teacher and learn to make a longbow or a composite bow...etc etc etc
I have also heard the idea of maybe making players who've come far enough masters of the skill and able to teach it, which i think would be cool...and fit in well with clans...
think about it..u get a really hard skill and master it...and now the clan has the advantage of everyone else in the clan getting the skill more easily
another thing that i know has been mentioned but i'm not sure if it was gonna be put into practice..but i think certain skills should be race limited..obviously a elf isn't gonna go around swinging a club..nor a troll using magic...

just some thoughts from the brain...
