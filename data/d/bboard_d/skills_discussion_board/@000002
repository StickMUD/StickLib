This is skills FAQ v1.0

Q: Are we allowed to have an unlimited number of skills?
A: No. You are limited to a set number of slots. When you fill
   all of them, you may choose no more skills. However, once
   you ascend a skill level, that slot will open up again.

Q: What do you mean by ascend and skill levels?
A: Some of you may consider this the downfall of the skills system;
   it's actually one of the saving graces. When you reach the point
   in your training where you can be considered a guru, you have
   learned all you can from your training. There is only one way
   to advance any further: you must start over. 

Q: Start over? What's the point in that?
A: When you start over, you begin the process of training anew,
   this time with a totally different perspective. You go through
   the basics again, much differently than the first time. Thus,
   when you get to the advanced techniques, you'll be learning things
   totally different. This is a good thing, and in technical terms,
   it means that your skills will be much better than the were at
   the same point in training the first time around.

Q: So how will my current training convert?
A: We'll have to rig a conversion room. The conversion room will
   take your skills into account, give you a certain amount of points
   to spend, and then force you to leave your guild. You may then
   allocate these points on any skills you find.

Q: Find? You mean not all skills will be immediately accessible?
A: Yup, you'll have to go out into the world and hunt them down.
   The less exotic skills will be taught in town. Happy hunting.
