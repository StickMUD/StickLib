Title: skills.. training?

Okay, so the new skills are in place.  Groovy.

Unfortunately they're all weapon skills.  As a thief I don't
experience "regular" weapon combat, so how do I train?

Every round I tth, and this means I don't get
to use my wielded weapon at all.  How do I
train weapon skills then?

Just curious..
