Already, let me try it this way:
Once you master a skill, you have the option of relearning it.
If you don't wish to do so, it will never rank again.
When you retrain a skill, what you actually do is trade in your old skill
for a more powerful version. It stays on your skill list,
but does not occupy a skill slot.
