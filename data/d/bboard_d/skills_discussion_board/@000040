Starks,
I agree with elyic.  Training is extremely slow, and I assume it will become even more difficult.  If you just add a couple more ranks, I can't imagine how difficult the training will be.  I don't want some great power either to slay others or dominate!  Training and levels are fun though.  And l
I've watched and not many are achieving those by training.  Something to think about.
