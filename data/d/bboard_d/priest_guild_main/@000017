What's the point of elections? What's the point of being on the mud in the first place?  It's for fun, and running for the same office doesn't mean it's boring, it means you do well with that job and you get to continue with the prividge of having that office.
Only 3 officers are run for, and the rest are appointed, so there is plenty of 
opportunity to move around. Basically, no office is boring if you make it fun, no matter how many times you have it.
This is the first time I've had the honor of being ViceGerant of this guild, and although trying at times,
I have found it to be quite interesting, and a position that I could look forward to having again.
I also know both of the Preceptor positions become very intense when the game actually gets roling and there are lots of raids...
Anyway..that's just my 2 cents...hope this insprires something in someone :)
