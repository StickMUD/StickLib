Hi, I just wanted to say 2 things.  First off, the list of officers 2 down from here is not available to all guild members.. I get a message saying You are still too young to understand the writing.  Well, I think that if I can't see who the guild leaders are, who do I have to look up to or go to for advice and with my problems?  I don't think it is right.
Secondly, I just wanted to say hi :)
