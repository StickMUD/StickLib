Well, I must say this in Silverlocks defense.  At least he ran for an office -- I didn't see anyone else running for Preceptor Templar!
By default he would have won even if no one voted for him.  
On the flip side of that, I agree with Apoc -- time to start filling that office -- would be nice to see all officers on the left hand side of that column.
