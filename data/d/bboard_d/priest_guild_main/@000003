1) read my note in the adventurers guild about a few priest bugs
--
Boards are reset

2) since the frobozz inn doesn't exist (or i can
grr..can't find it, how about some new places where we could get
herrings..perhaps more then in the old stick..perhaps a fish store?
along these sames lines, some new potions would be nice..but i'll come up with
some ideas later..it's too late now and i'm too tired..
--
I will look into this now, new potions is not an immediate concern,
but we will keep it in mind.  I hope to find a coder to take good
care of the priests.  Herrings soonish.

3) we can't seem to find any places to get some easy staffs..demon town is gone
and we could get some little ones there..might be a good idea to recode some
areas where little priests could get a staff or stick
--
Name me the exact staffs that are usable to you and I will see what
I can do.

4) need to take the lord req. for officership off for now..at least until there
are some lords again :)
--
Next week perhaps, maybe sooner.  I don't even know how priest voting
takes place so perhaps someone could explain the process.

5) the nonlord (and maybe lord list too) doesn't word..only shows one
player..at least last time i looked
okay..i'm going to bed..

Actually, they work fine.  The script that we use to make them needs
updated again like we did on the Pinsys machine.  Kieve will work on
that when he gets around to it.  We are trying to organize all the
tasks of the mud by a sort of priority.
