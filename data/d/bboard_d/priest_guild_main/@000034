Title: another reason the officer list readable

Let's say I'm a mean old thief, and I want to start attacking priest officers...
By guild law, priests aren't suppose to tell who the officers are, or say anything about any internal guild matters...
Now, if anyone can read that list, mean old thief me makes a quick second, goes and reads the list and wham..i can pick on priest officers..and/or spread the knowledge...

Now, of course, just wanting to kill priest officers is dumb..but I'm all too familiar with quick seconsd to gain inside knowledged...
This is one of many ways that "cheating" like this is defered.  Just my two sense..I've always been a real guild 'loyalist' if you will..I share nothing with no one!!!

Just another two cents from me...
