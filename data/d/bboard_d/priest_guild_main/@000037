I tested the damages a bit with Elyic and we noticed that we do not
do very high damages at all *grin* 
Elyic's sandstorm did to me with zero defence ~40 and stonerain ~60. 
The rate of 1sp : 1,5damage isn't very glamorous :P 
I'm just suggesting a small scale upgrade when it comes to damages, 
to be more competitive with the thieves' guild. We are also followers 
of Caine, so we are supposed to be good at this shit, but it seems 
we're not. Perhaps make it worthwhile, oh mighty admins?
