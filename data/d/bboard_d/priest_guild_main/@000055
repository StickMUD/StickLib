As I have told Messiah last night, I didn't realise my "picking" on him bothered him so much and that I would stop.  I do not feel that this is any excuse for him or other members of Gunn to take up hostilities -- we are, after all, still a guild...
and words are only words, but I will stop.  
On these terms, I should suggest that all players start acting more like priests, myself included, and should they not, that we should handle it like the priest guild we are.
