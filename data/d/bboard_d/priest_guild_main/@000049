hmm thats disgusting, i would hope that everyone knows how to use a toilet quietly.
Yet, I agree, many of us officers are past prime (like myself) i served while i could, but now i havent had the time to continue my training in the eyes of the church. I move to change officers also (I still want a small position :P)
Apocalypse the ever obedient server.
