Title: BUG

Hello all, I noticed a little bug for this guild.
We all know how important our faith is, and we all try to keep it very strong.
I noticed that when you go linkdead, you loose faith. 
I had this happen to me twice so far
I went linkdead, and could not
reconnect for a few hours. My faith went from Very Strong to weak each time.
This should not happen.
