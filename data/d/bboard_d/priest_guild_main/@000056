Title: Apology
Name: Messiah
Date: Feb  9

  In the sake of the guild, I Apologize.  I apologize to Timebomb, but more 
importantly I apologize to my fellow priests, who have been hurt by my 
actions.  In this regard, under penalty of expulsion, I promise not to irate
any other priest as long as the church of boccob exists.
