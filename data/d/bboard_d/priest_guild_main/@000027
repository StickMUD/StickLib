Pissed because you didn't get an office -- didn't get an office cuz your attitude sucks and is negative.
The officer in question was given that office because they follow Seth..that was the qualification set by at least two of the 3 elected officers...Kregar was the first choice...but we decided he made a better Inquisitor...and he is in no way my friend...but he is VERY up to the job.
If you don't like the politics of this mud (as set down by Paradox..new mud..new politics) you can do two thigns...
-1 -- put yourself in a position to change them -- hell..you didn't even run for an office 
-2 -- quit
do either..but chill with the whining..no one likes the attitude..

PS.  If you were so interested in an office..why didn't you post or mail me saying so?  
Additionally, there is no reason why a change can't be made..we just did it so we'd have the benefits of officers..I never object to a criticism...as long as it's constructive..
Your criticism was not only JUST negative...it was almost what I would call insultive in the face of your guild leaders
Finally, I will say this...coeffs do not make officers..what does you ask?
determination to fill that office, good politics, good relations, lots of online time, lots of association with your fellow guild members, and most importantly..playing a RPG role which defines that office...
