Well, here is the way I see it -- anyone who wants to be an officer bad enough will eventually get to be one.
I have a feeling with this new mud, we are going to see maybe 1 or 2 dominant players..and the poles for the rest are going to be a challedge.
As far as the VG assigning all positions -- it's actually the coders who do it, and it's all current officers who decide..not just VG.
Hope this cleared things up and maybe shed a little light on the issue.
