Title: Officers...

Fellow Priests,

I'd like everyone interested in being an officer to post here and let me know so we can give everyone a fair shot!!
If you'd rather not post, mudmail to me which position you'd like.
Open positions are the electors (medico and secularus) and inquisitor..
Elyic, being the old fart kinda priest he is, is my first choice for Cardinal if he accepts...(or doesn't say anything to the contrary)..
Acolyte will be assigned to the next new guild member...

Preceptors, please post your suggestions for officers on the Bell Tower board up from here..
If anyone doesn't know which officers are which, read advice officers.

May Boccob make all your days bright..
