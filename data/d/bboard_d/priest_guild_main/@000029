Title: TimeBomb's ViceGerant Address
Name: Funakoshi
Date: Dec  6

Hello All,
I've pretty much been here since this mud opened. I do like the differences between
this mud and Stick. I fully agree with TB's address. This isn't a chat board. It is 
a ... for lack of a better word... GAME. It is for having fun. And like TB said, 
it is not for argueing over outside worlds toppics. The Mud channel, and the Priest
channel are always being SPAMMED. This sucks. for the main reason, if you are trying
to read something on the screen, and 10 people start spamming, you don't have time to
read. This isn't good for the newbies or the regulars. 
read. This isn't good for the newbies or the regulars. 
sorry about the double line. hehe. Damn. client. hehe.

If you have to talk about Real Life topics, use tells. It works much better for the 
people who don't realy care if for example your going for pizza or not. 

Well on a final note
lets just have fun. 
Later all
Funakoshi
