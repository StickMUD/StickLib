Title: Hello again.

Well it's been a while.. And there's a quite logical explanation to
my absense: I didn't have enough money to pay my phonebill.. even now I'm
surprised that I'm able to use my phone line, so.. Anyhow, I'm back at
least kinda, dunno how long this luxury of having a fully operational
phone line is going to last. :)

The price of freedom is eternal vigilance. (or something, ungh..)
