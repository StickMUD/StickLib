Title: Clan areas
Name: Tamarindo
Date: Mar 18

Look at /clans/gunn directory.  In order to get your clan in the room code,
the defs.h, the items all need to be in there exactly looking as they do
there... and I mean exactly!  EXACTLY!!!!.  Make no special functions
for these rooms... just rooms, a board, the standard donation box, a sign.

That is it... we will do more later... lets get these out into the game.

We need (together) to plan an NPC strategy (GUARDS).  Everyone will have
same amount and strength guards initially.

Post questions, but my advise is look at gunn dir... code EXACTLY like that,
just change room descs and positions.

Thanks,
