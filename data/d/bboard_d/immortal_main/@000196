Title: Aclaration on how to use Wandering Monsters Code
Name: Rhayam
Date: Mar 28

Ok, I found out that in the hedges code, 
the hedgesRoom.c room was added to the maze.

This is not the way to use the paradigm I created.

There are two cases:

1) You DO NOT want to move the monsters
at an specific event.  Only
at each reset of the room (after
the monster have died).

goto my workroom, then go to 'examples' and
then 'wandering'.

Then type 'more here' and you will see the code I used 
for type 1.

2) You DO want to bring in a monster in a specific event.

In case of the Hedges, you want the monster to come
in when a player enters a specific room.  And you want
to move a max of monsters equivalent of monsters
that you added in the creators room.

You DO NOT allow the monsters to move out of the
room except with the mechanism of the creator room.
(No wandering out).

For an example, go to my workroom, and enter 'examples' and
then poppins (or something like that), and do 'more here' to
see the creator room code.

then go to 'cloud' (or something like that) and do 'more here' 
so you can see, how we bring a monster to this room when a 
player or coder enters this room.

IMPORTANT NOTE: add the code for 'clean_up' on your monsters
so prevent a problem of the monsters walking around.
I believe that code is at:

/areas/magic_mansion/npc/hedge.c

Any question, mud mail me.
