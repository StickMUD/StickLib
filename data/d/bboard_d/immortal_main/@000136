yes thats right i'll fix the things that go wroung with my area like bugs typos and such BUT

here its is Rember the hobbit oak on stick?

WELL im codeing it again
with a twist
you know me im twisted

ok if you try to enter the oak you bonk your head off it 
don't worry it only takes 10hps

this area you'll climb up the tree and kill squirrels and birds and little kids in a tree house etc etc

it will be a newbie area

Ooze

PS any ideas on monsters that can be up in a tree?
