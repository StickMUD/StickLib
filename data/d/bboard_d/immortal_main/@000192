Title: Ideas...

Baptist and I had a long talk last night concerning the mud and I figured that I should go ahead and post some of them...
One thing we both read was that webpage, and on the basis of wimping (not that we were gonna do it on this mud) but I think we need to be checking weapon/armour wc/ac better...basically because we don't want to be dg'ing it later..
I don't know if there was just a few of us who made this mistake on our first few areas..but its going to be a bad thing to dg it all later...ie wimping..and that's a mud killer...so lets keep it balanced fromt he beginning..

A future thing we ere talking about was a way to waste  more player exp and make money more valuable...
One of my ideas was to add a few more stats..luck, for instance...or add a stat that would augment the first set of stats by doing something like healing or regening sps faster...

As far as money..I think Baptist has some good ideas with clans to make it more valuable...but I'll let him speak in more detail about that...
One of my ideas was for everytime a guard gets killed..depending on his level/stats...takes a certain amount of money to replace (taken from the clan funds).
That way it is possible to really wage war and see true damage to a clan..insetead of just waiting until the next reset.

Just some thoughts..most of which are for future consideration..i know we havea lot on the table..but i don't want to forget.

comments? questions? you know where to stick 'em *laughs* jk
