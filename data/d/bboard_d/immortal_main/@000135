Title: Ideas to attract players

Maybe this wouldn't work, but as my brain started slowly creaking to come up with an idea of how to encourage more players, this crossed my mind.


Senerios

Maybe pick one night a week, or sometime that we think a good number of players could play and create a senerio for the clans or individuals.


Example -  You are trying to bring desperate needed medicine to your brother clan.  They are dying from a deadly disease that is spreading fast, and soon they might be wiped out.  You need to make the medicine *collect 4 things? *  And deliver it to them in xx amount of time.  The only problem is another clan would like to see your family die.  So they will be trying to stop you as you go on your mission.  (or the admins could become mortal and try to stop quest)


Maybe for that period no one would lose pk exp death to increase play.  


Some live interactive games could be addictive and fun.  Just a wild thought.
