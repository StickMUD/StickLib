Title: Lockable chests
Name: Tamarindo

Hi guys,
    I made a new inheritable, a lockable chest... I needed
to have it for new shops and storages.  I made a simple man
page for it (man chest).  The inheritable is in /lib/chest.c.
There is also /std/obj/chest.c, but it does not do as much...
I have to leave it in there for compatability for now.
