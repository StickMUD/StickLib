Title: RE: What I'm working on
Name: Elwood
Date: Feb 20


Working on my area - the faerie forest.  It's got quite a bit done already, but
I'm being pulled away and I'm going to be working most of the next 4-5 
weekends so I won't have a lot of time to code, but I'll be working on it
when I can!!

The whole area is going to be quite extensive so it may be a while before I
consider it big enough for an opening.  Getting there though.

-Elwood.
PS: Players getting bored? Been there, done that.. Tam you need to advertise!!
