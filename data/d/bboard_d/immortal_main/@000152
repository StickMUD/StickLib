Title: Exp cheat

I believe there is a rather large exp bug in Ooze's area.
One of his monsters "Hedges" is where I think it is at.
Snipe (who was on as snip observed it being abused by paranoid and grinch)

Once the monster dies, it resets automatically as 'mortally wounded'
That way it can easily be killed over and over for 75,000exp a piece.
