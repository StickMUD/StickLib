I understand that this is not the time for a lot of these ideas--that we need to get the basics in before the wild stuff...but, Baptist and I had talked about an idea which I haven't seen mentioned, but which I think needs to be taken into consideration.
I don't think we should move Tristesa.  Rename it, changed descriptions, add a newbie training area, etc...but leave the basic structure intact...it does a lot to pull people from Stickmud (bringing them into a familiar area)..
and maybe I'll even learn to spell it right :)...but, I think that's a thought worth mentioning now.   I know skills and clans are what's on the plate for the day, but before someone goes and codes a new town, I think we need to take that into consideration.
