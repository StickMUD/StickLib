Title: Doors are not Tink's friend :)

Alrighty, here's the deal. Thanks to axphism, we got the lock finally right. However, which ever door loads first is the one that the description holds for both doors. Here's my question. Does each side of the door have to be exactly the same? Or is there a way to make them different.
Totally lost behind a maze of doors,
