Title: Thoughts needed
Name: Scarab
Date: Mar 30


I've been working on an intellegent monster as some of you know..one that fights like a player..and been kicking the idea of a small area dedicated to it with ax and tam.
My thought for this area was to create an arena where ther player could set the monsters level and fight it for practice...and also, it would have some kind of log to give me feedback.
I intend to use this monster in my other areas, but don't want to try too many new things all at once..which is why I want to introduce this in a seperate small area....
that, and if i can concentrate on that, some other coders could use it's template without having to wait on my new "real" area.

I'd like to get some feedback on whta people think of the entire idea..buoth the area and the monster...as well as other uses and ideas where we could implement this thing

I'm not going to post the location of it yet, as it is not done..but i would take suggestions for more states things it can do..
Here is what it can do so far.
Judge if it -
needs to heal
needs to flee
is fighting a bigger player then itself
if it is fighting a smaller player then itself
if it is fighting multiple players (all these so i can choose a proper stradegy)

It can also queue 3 attackers...ie fight 3 ppl at once

What I haven't finished, but play on puttin in -
attacks using all C_ conditions (random)
an area attack..one for full area..one just for attackers..
the ability to go invis and be sneaky
the ability to set "traps" like priest poison in a room.

Okay..i think that's all I had...

Later additions will include a limitation on number of spells and attacks via spell points and fatique points...but right now all that checking would be a little much..basics first...

Let me know.
