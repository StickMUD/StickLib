Title: Report on wandering monsters
Name: Rhayam

Ok, after a good deal of research, here is where I stand.

1) If you do not care of the count of wandering monsters.

If you use only the 'add_monster', and you do not do funky
stuff like creating a monster each time that a player enters
the room, then the only thing that you need to
do is:

add: 'set(NO_CLEANUP)' int: create_room()

and 'add_monster' up to the max of monsters that you want
wandering. (DO NOT PUT THE add_monsters ANYWHERE ELSE BUT
In create_room() ).

I ran into a situation, that I haven't been able to test it fully:

The wandering monsters get dested at rooms that they wander in.

I think that with 'add_monster' this is solved, but if all the sudden
your room do not create more monster when all of them are gone.

add this code to your wandering monster:

int
clean_up(int refs) {

// I am a wandering monster. You do not clean up on me!

return 0;
}

2) You DO want to keep a count of the monsters that are wandering.

In this case, I have not found an effecient way to generate on the need basis
monster with 'add_monsters' (add_monster increases the monsters created
by one, so if you did a function that add a monster eachtime the user
enters, when the next reset happens, you will have a BUNCH of monsters).

So I created some logic with 'clone_object'.

I had separated this in 2 room files and one monster file per each 
different type of wandering monster created in that room.

Example of wandering monsters creator file:

/areas/magic_mansion/rooms/m2.c

and check: room_init()

there you will se the hook I set for a monster creation each time
the user enter that room.

Example of (eerrr, oooops)
Example before was the applcation of the creator file.
The following example is the actual monster creator file:

/areas/magic_mansion/rooms/hedgesRoom.c

Example of the monster being created:

/areas/magic_mansion/npc/hedge.c

IMPORTANT: we are not using the add_monster mechanism, so WE DO NEED
           the method I specified before about clean_up the monster.
          Otherwise, they will be cleaned up, and will not notify
          the mechanism in the creator room that they are already gone.

Hmmm, I think I cover everything.

Any questions?
