Hehe!
  That is cool =)  I would at sometime like to make something where
one could look long distance over an area - a modification of what
you have done there I suppose.

BTW,
  if you guys find stuff typo'd or broken in the mud and fix it
collect it in one directory and I will give you some coders points
for fixing it.  Hopefully when I get some more time I will get
the access sitated here better... if we did have the kingdoms
(earth, wind, water and fire) on the move it would be more important,
but we will get there.

Coding is fun - it is a form of magic, that is why you are wizards
and not just coders =P  We will make being a wizard more of a grand
position and experience with (again) more time =P

Keep working hard on those areas to make your wizard a grand name
here!
