I would just like you guys to know I am looking/hoping for
you to be doing areas that are neat in code and creative.
If you want more levels to do more things this would be
the way to go.  I think this summer we are really going
to be doing some exciting stuff, and we will need some
of you to help lead the way... so if you desire this,
try to keep things simple, interesting and neat.  No need
to suck up or anything hehe... just code for now =)

Organize, Neat, Interesting, Quiet sometimes? =P  All
keywords here =)

Thanks,
