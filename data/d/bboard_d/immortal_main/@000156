I shifted his exp back to what is was before he cheated
and he lost his coder character.  Please, if any of you
see bugs while playing tell us.  By being coders that makes
your doubly responsible for things like this.  On a bad
day i might have just totally erased Paranoid.  I can
stand a lot of things, but in matters where cheating can
have a direct result on other players and tampers with
the natural course of the game... nah... that does not sit
well with me at all.
