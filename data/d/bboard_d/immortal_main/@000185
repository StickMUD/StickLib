Title: stats

All stats were bought with an xxx amount of exp.  If all players are reinbursed this amount for all their stats there would be no exp loss.  
Then people could use that exp to raise the new max stat to that level, so you would have no extreme player with super high stats.

I don't think I agree with unlimited stats.  We are powerful enough atm . :)
