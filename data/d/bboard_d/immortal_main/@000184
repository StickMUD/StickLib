I like the idea of expanding stats up to level 90, but there is one little problem with this.
First off, you have level 45 players who are full statted and how would you handle that?
Thats going to make things very hairy if you handle it like race change and just let them catch up in level...you'll have some very supreme players for a long time!
I do like the idea of unlimited stats, which, relative to each other, are based on race (which I'd like to see a few more of, as well)
Basically, I'd say move current stats up to about level 60 (midpoint) and then make them unlimted..that way you don't have players that are way way way supreme
okay, that's not a midpoint..but somewhere in the middle is what i was suggesting

on the issue of bigger, badder clan areas -- I like the idea of a standard compliment coming with the clan purchase...
I also like the idea of buying more stats, and I think we might just want to have a stat store..
It would take a lot of load off coders..I could by 10 hps and have a control menu to add them to bob the guard or somethign..just a thought
