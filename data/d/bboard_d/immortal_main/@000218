Title: Doors still hate Tink.
Name: Tink

New problem. /areas/t_town/rooms/h1 ... on first reboot, if you knock on the west door, there is an error message that prevents you from going west into the room. However, if I go there and cc room, you knock and it works a-ok. The error only occurs on the first reboot.
How the room works: a player knocks on the west door, the monster inside says "come on in" and the door unlocks and opens. the player goes into the house, and the door is closed and locked. the player then kills the monster in the house, searches and finds a key to get out of the house.
It works wonderfully well as soon as the room has been reset manually after a boot. Please help me :)
I tried some things with Jack today, but nothing seemed to work. I tried looking at the Amos code for his door, but the code is long and quest involved. From that, it appears that the monster physically unlocks the door with a key through being forced. We can try to do this if it will fix it, but please advise.
Tink, the one who hates doors.
