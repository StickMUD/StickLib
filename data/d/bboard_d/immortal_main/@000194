    Ok, clear out your minds and imagine you were visiting here
for the first time.  You would probably login, then logout!  If
we don't work on this issue, then all we are doing here is for
nothing.

    Imagine the game as a tree.  What some of you would wish us
to work on are things way out on the branches, which have effect
on a smaller percentage of our players.  But if the root is dying,
all the new branches we build are going to die soon anyways.

    We need to make the mud more marketable to newbie players
and create a faster addiction ;)  Things need cleaned up, such
as help files and commands.  We need better color usage and
an introduction area to get people adjusted quickly.  We need
a new main town eventually that fits in with 'the big plan'
of what the mud should be looking like (w/ kingdoms).  Focus
on your areas for now, and let me work on planning the base
of this stuff, then I will present it to you and we can work
on modifying it for maximum fun.
