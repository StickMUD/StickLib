The Mayor's newspaper (/std/obj/newspaper.c) is empty.  It appears to "cat" a file called /NEWSPAPER in order to generate the contents.  I unfortunately don't seem to have access, but thought I'd post a note here for whoever does.  The place has plenty of news, and I am thinking the newspaper would be a sweet way to spread information consistently and fairly.

We could then communicate things to the players more via the paper and the travel agency board, instead of just posting notes in the Adv Guild..  It seems more authentic to hear news that way.  A Town Crier would be sweet as well.  Or one of those little rugrats selling newspapers on the streets of Newbie York ("Extra, Extra!  Read all about it!  Kieve Convicted of Molesting Sheep..  Again..").

PS:  Is this the place for posting suggestions?

PPS:  If it's not, I'm damn glad Bull isn't here to ban me for using the wrong board..
