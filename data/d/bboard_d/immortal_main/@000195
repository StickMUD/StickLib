Title: hedges
Name: Baptist

Apocalypse reported bug that hedges seemed to be messing up again.  I sent a tell to 
him that there is so suppose to be more than one, and he told me there were around 100 hedges running around.  Rhayam fixed the problem I believe...I'm going to reward Apocalypse for turning in a bug without abusing it.
