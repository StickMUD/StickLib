Title: checks

I often go thru your area dirs to check your progress, but
being that we are having so much progress it is tough to
remember one from another and what i checked... so if you
could put something in your areas dir like CHECK or whatever
I will take a good look.

Also, perhaps now since we have so many we should start
talking about designing a new city together and some other
future plans for the MUD.  Any cool suggestions?  Post as
much as ya like =P
