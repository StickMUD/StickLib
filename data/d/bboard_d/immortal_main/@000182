Title: re stats
Name: Shotgun
Date: Mar 21

What about being able to raise stats at _any_ level. At least
it would add more variance to the mud (A lvl 20 with max
stats would put up a good fight to someone level 30 with
less stats). 
Also, what about extending stats indefinately? What I mean
by this is that once you reach your current maxed stats
for race, you could continue to raise them .. yet it should
be extremely expensive! 10-15M exp for an additional 5hp for
example.

Just another late night idea.
