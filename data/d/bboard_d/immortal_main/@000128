Title: Importance of the pack.
Name: Joseph
Date: Feb 20

Wolves, wild dogs, hyennas, lions, coyotes, birds, piranas, fishppl, goblins, gnomes orcs elves trolls humans. We all hunt in packs.  I will work on a global object that will allow any pack member call his fellow packers from where ever
they are.  It is going to take me a while because I am leaving for a few weeks to move and get a job. But it shall be done. Is personal now....
