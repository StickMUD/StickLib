I like that idea. Also, as clans get bigger and they prosper with wealth,
purchasing more guards or upgrading existing ones (or get more resources
to play with -- for example, 1M coins could get them 5000 hp, 10 wc, etc.
or whatever). This would make distinguishing kickass clans from the high
and powerful ones and poor clans easy to raid (until they too prosper).

Also, what about the idea of 'purchasing' more rooms. 1M gc/ room sounds
reasonable. 


Muts (just thinking of future ideas)
