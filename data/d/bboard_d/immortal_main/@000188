Title: Unused
Name: Tamarindo
Date: Mar 24

Hi guys,
   I dug up /areas/desert/npc/unused, which I believe was to be
used in what was to be Jerusalem, which an old wiz at StickMUD named
Raymond was to make.  A lot of the monsters there load... if anyone
would like to make a city around them, feel free =)
