Title: Area
Name: Shotgun
Date: Mar 30

I've noticed that my area doesn't reset as quick as the rest of the mud.
Renegade mentioned to me that it's been over an hour and a half since it
was cleaned out and hasn't reset. Kalelle also mentioned the same thing..
If someone has a minute, could you please take a brief look to see if
I missed something in the code? Thanks
