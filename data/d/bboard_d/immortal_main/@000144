Well, it only took me the entire weekend, but I finally managed to code
a secret 'door'.  And as it turns out there was no one on when I
triumphed...so this is just me patting myself on the back.  8)

I've had more fun coding here in the past week than I've had in the past
year of mudding.  Thanks for the opportunity Tam!
