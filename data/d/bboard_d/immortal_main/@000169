Title: Ooops, forgot about wandering monsters

Greetings:

   For case #2, I believe the logic of the creator room and
the room that receives the monsters can be implemented with 
add_monster.

   Put the max of monsters that you want to be created, in the
monster creator room, by performing the 'add_monster' that number of times.
Then you will need to create a function that each time someone request
a monster, you check if there is one, other wise, ignore.

   The kewl part is that you will not need to keep a count, since
add_monster will take care of this for you.

Hmmm, I will check if I can implemented on the weekend.
