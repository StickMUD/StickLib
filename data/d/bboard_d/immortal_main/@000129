Title: Taking off...
Name: Joseph
Date: Feb 22

Ok folks it has been fun! I am leaving in 2 days for California in the search
of a new job.  I dont have where to stay, so I will be homeless for a while,
staying with friends here and there.  As soon as I have a place all set up
including phone and all the good stuff I shall be back. I do not know how
soon that will be. Take care everyone!
keep up the good work!


Joseph (the Mess-i) one.... ah.....
