Let me be direct =)

In order to get things right here we have to set good goals
and manage our time wisely.  We are in a growing phase right
now, where I help teach you how to code (hopefully the right
way) and you keep building more and more coding skills, and
with you I am learning along the way.  Much like playing the
game, with time, our skills are growing.  I cannot hang with
the big boys quite yet when it comes to the actual creation
of new systems, but every night I am getting closer to that.

We will pass into the second phase together, where we build
a good structured organization.  Together, we will divide and
conquer the coding tasks before us, where some of you may
become arches and have (almost) full control over 1/4 of the
game and your own staffs of wizards.  Each kingdom will have
an arch.  So code well now, and listen to the ways I ask you
to code your areas, because this has only just begun.

Our aim is to make the mudlib work cleanly, while be easy
for our coders to keep creating in the interest of maximium
fun for everyone who comes to play Shadowchaser.  Stats,
skills, color, better pk all come with this in the proper
time.  We are not just going to go the distance, but do our
best to lead the pack =)
