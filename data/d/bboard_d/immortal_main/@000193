As an idea for use of money...
(And I understand that these are long term ideas)..
If a clan could buy healing rooms.  The could rent a 1hp/1sp/1fp per 15sec tick healing room.   Or 2/2/2 , up to 5hp/5sp/5fp per 15second tick.  This of course would be very expensive for the guild to maintain.  Regular healing rates that we have now would have to be lowered some I imagine. 

I know money is basically worthless here as it is.  Eq lies around and is not sold.  I know i've been on muds where almost everything is picked up and sold.  Gold had value there, it was needed to xp and live basically.  I'd like to see gold have more value here.

Baptist Greenspan, who would like to get this inflation under control!
