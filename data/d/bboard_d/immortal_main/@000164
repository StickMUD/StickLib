Ok,
   I am a bit busy in making the shops/storages more
standardized I suppose you could call it... I am not
sure if any of you have tried to make a shop, but you
have to change up a lot of functions for each specific
shop in most cases.  I am working on making this more
abstract so you can just set the type of shop(s) you
wish to have.  This also will work for storage areas,
for clans and such because the code handles that too.
I believe this could also help with our idea of future
'player owned & operated' shops to go along with the
new skills system.  I hope to have this ready soon, and
after that I may tackle the restaurant and pub codes as
well.  Bear with me.
