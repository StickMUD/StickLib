Title: Santa 2
Name: Sable
Date: Dec 22

Assuming that each of these 108 million stops is evenly distributed
around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false, but will accept
for the purposes of our calculations), we are now talking about 0.78
miles per household
a total trip of 75.5 million miles, not counting
bathroom stops or breaks.  This means Santa's sleigh is moving at 650
miles per second--3,000 times the speed of sound.  For purposes of
comparison, the fastest man made vehicle, the Ulysses space probe, moves
at a poky 27.4 miles per second, and a conventional reindeer can run (at
best) 15 miles per hour.

Still more coming..
