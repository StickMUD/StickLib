Title: Santa
Name: Sable
Date: Dec 22

There are approximately two billion children (persons under 18) in the
world.  However, since Santa does not visit children of Muslim, Hindu,
Jewish or Buddhist (except maybe in Japan) religions, this reduces the
workload for Christmas night to 15% of the total, or 378 million
(according to the population reference bureau).  At an average (census)
rate of 3.5 children per household, that comes to 108 million homes,
presuming there is at least one good child in each.  Santa has about 31
hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and
the rotation of the earth, assuming east to west (which seems
logical). This works out to 967.7 visits per second.  This is to say
that for each Christian household with a good child, Santa has around
1/1000 th of a second to park the sleigh, hop out, jump down the
chimney, fill the stocking, distribute the remaining presents under the
tree, eat whatever snacks have been left for him, get back up the
chimney, jump into the sleigh and get onto the next house.
