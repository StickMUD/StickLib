Title: A little attention to life =)

Hiyas fellow chasers ...

Just wanted to thank all of you for making Shadowchaser such a great place.  Things in life have become quite busy and require more attention.  School is coming to a closure in the next month, new summer job getting lined up, and of course time with Brina and other friends I've decided is something I want to make the most of.
I'd like to say I'm quitting all together for these reasons, but as any addict knows, it's much easier to leave for awhile.  
Just want to wish the best for everyone here.  I've enjoyed getting to know most of you, and I must say, it's been fun =)
I hope administration continues to make great new skills, rooms, and of course bring in new players.
I'll be checking in from time to time to say hey, and of course to check out the new global skill/clan situation =).  Otherwise if you find a moment of time, send me an email here 'cause I'd love to hear from you.   Or mail me at mlittleh@mines.edu

Been fun!
