I didnt feel like wasting my time on Adv board and not healing so im writing this here :)
I onI once played a mud where we were aboe to choose are own stats (aboe=able) by doing this your exp would either cost a high amount for more skills or a low amount for low skills. With this system a person with every stat possible would take like 10k first level and be exponentially for each level, this way the would have all the skills, but would take forever in leveling, on the other hand a person could get 1 or 2 skills and be a really high level. I really liked this system, and while we working on a new system, i wanted to hear what everyone else things, espcially admins...
