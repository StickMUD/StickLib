I found this excerpt from an old travel digest which I thought might prove
to be beneficial.

The Land Of Al-tania:
    Al-tania is the name for both a city, and a much larger
geographic region. Contact was established a short time ago,
and the merchant outposts were set up for the purposes of
trade and communication. The only people that remain in the
region of Al-tania are the desert nomads. However, there
are many other creatures native to the desert.
    Al-tania(the city) was destroyed ages ago, in a storm
of fire. The city gates have been magically sealed to
prevent people from entering, and possibly injuring
themselves. (It is also rumored that something is being
kept in) Plans have been preposed by some of the nomads for
restoring the city, and repopulating it.
    Water is a necessity in the desert. The traveller should
carry a waterskin at all times. Given the opportunity, he
should also 'fill' it at any place water is accessible. No
known sources of water have been found to be completely
unfit for human consumption.
