Title: The Gauntlet
Name: Scarab
Date: Mar 14

Greeting Adventurers, ever wonder what your fighting skills are really worth?  Now is your chance to find out!!!!
West of town, a new and mighty fortress is being built by the cave dwarves, and I haven't heard of anyone to return yet -- test your might, and you might be the first, or you might just be in tomorrow obituaries!

Abuse this area well, and bring friends, and lunch -- you'll need both -- because this area will abuse you...

Enjoy,
Scarab the Harmfull

PS Mudmail me what you think -- exp vs. difficulty and how far you have gotten.  It is intended for around level 40 chars or parties of lesser lords.  Let me know if I hit the mark
