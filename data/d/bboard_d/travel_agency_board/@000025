Title: Dark and Dangerous caves...
Name: Baptist
Date: Apr  6

   Three days ago a mortal friend of mine had disappeared.  His family pleaded with me to go and find him.  I quickly agreed.  He was one always looking for adventure, and I was quite sure he'd be ok.
   It took me a few days to track him.  He had traveled through many dangerous areas already.  Finally, I traced him to a large cave.  It was in the northern area, close to a dangerous pass.  I entered the caves, but I was too late.  Sadly, I returned what was left of him to his family.
   Please listen to me my friends.  While there is great treasure in the caves, they also hold many dangers.  Use caution when you seek the cave's wealth.  I do not want to see more of my friends die.

Concerned for your health and safety,
Baptist
