Title: Faithfull followers of Boccob!
Name: Leonardo
Date: Mar 10

Like all of the original members of the priesthood, I followed Boccob. As time went by, factions, or clans as you might call them, caused rifts throughout the priesthood.
For several generations, the temple in landover has been forgotten.
It lies there rotting and decaying... but by no means is it dead!
BE WARNED, this temple may have changed with time and may not be full of faithfull followers of Boccob such as you and me.
PRECEDE WITH CARE!
P.S you can begin the search as I did and look for an altar which was the secret to the temples ways.
