Title: Just back from a recent exploration...
Name: Leonardo
Date: Mar 12

I was recently visiting some lands in the far southwest, when I came across a path that led to a group of caves. I heard loud noises from within but dared not to enter, for I am a wuss as you all know. So I point you in the direction of the southern woods. Have fun exploring.
