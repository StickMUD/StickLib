Title: Pontos
Name: Paradox
Date: Dec 11

A bustling port of commerce has sprung up outside the city of
Pontos, although they have been having a pirate problem as of
late that the guards don't seem to care to stop.  Perhaps you
could be of some assistance.  You would be doing a great service
to Newbie York by helping keeping the flow of trade moving from
this eastern port!
