Title: The Dark Master is arrived.
Name: Suldrun
Date: Jan 30

He came with anger... The first thing he did was to force his slaves to create for his own pleasure a big beautiful fortress.
Now, the fortress is done. Somewhere, near Newbie York, it stands. It's hidden, but it's here.
The Dark Master is preparing his army to raid and massacre all Newbie York inhabitants.
His troops are made with the more vicious and cruel orcs he found all over the world.
They came from the savage lands with their Wolves, and few Wargs.
As a hero of Newbie York, it's your duty to go there and to kill the general of the Dark Master, the well known Gradgul, the Master of the Dagalur tribe.
Few stupid, selfish adventurers came there to do this great action, but... they didn't think that those orcs can be that powerful.
Don't go there alone, or you'll die.

Elmore, the only survivor of the 5th failed raid over Dark Master's place.
