Title: New city discovered!
Name: Tink

While on a recent vacation with Leonardo the explorer, we were taking a swim to relax when we found a mysterious cave.
After exploring the cave and wandering around for awhile, we found the lost city of Gandolf. 
It is a very rough town, although there is lots of activities for brave explorers to partake in.
Have fun, but be careful!
Your friend and fellow explorer,
Tink
