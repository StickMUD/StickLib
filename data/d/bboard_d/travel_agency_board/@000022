Title: Mysterious Mountain
Name: Shotgun
Date: Mar 23

Earlier in my travels, I passed through a town in a not too faroff land. The people were rambling in the streets about great riches on some mountain. One townfolk told me an ancient Centaur named Chester is the only one who knows of it's location.
I did not seek Chester for more information as I was called to a distant cave to battle a fierce dragon. Perhaps you may find and ask him about the mountain.
