Title: Master Miles Magic Mansion
Name: Ooze
Date: Feb 19

Magic use to be a lost art. Now magic has come back. A portal has showed up west of town because a wealthy magician named Miles Millhouse has lost his favorite toy and has sent out a personal invitation to you to come to his mansion and help him find it.
He just built his mansion here and he seems to have lost it in a box somewhere. The mansion is a little empty now but will fill up soon! Miles is just begun to settle in his new house. Maybe you should go down there and help him out and introduce yourself to him, his sons, and his servants.
