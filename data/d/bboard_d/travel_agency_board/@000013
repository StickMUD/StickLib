Title: Clan Chisholm
Name: Baptist
Date: Mar 14

A new clan has entered the mud.  Clan Chisholm, the centaur clan.  With a motto of 'Feros Ferio' they defend their village.  If you plan on raiding this clan, you had better bring some friends.  These centaurs are well armed and trained. Keep a careful look out, because dangers lurk about.  These centaurs have been spotted north of the clearing, where mushrooms were once known to grow.
