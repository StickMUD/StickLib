Title: Did you see it!?!
Name: Scarab
Date: Mar 25

Ahh...did you see it? I was searching around east of town, looking for some monsters to challedge you little players, and there it was...POOF! Out of the sky it came...a huge metal object..crashed into the Frozbozz Inn, destroying it.
I figured all the monsters would be scared off by the fire, so I searched elsewhere for a while, but when I returned, behold, there was a mighty tower of cat-like beings!
They call themselves the Kilrathi, and they are fierce fighters.  Behold, one of them even scratched me.  Venture at your own cost, but I overheard one of them talking about how the tower was a trap of sorts.

Best of luck -- you'll need it.
