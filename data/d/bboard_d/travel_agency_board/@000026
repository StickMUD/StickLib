Title: My dear old friend is gone
Name: Scarab
Date: Apr  8

Ahh, here I am again speaking to you mortals, and a sad day it is.  

I was going to visit my old friend Huima, and I found his home and the surrounding area destroyed!!!

You could imagine my anguish, as he has killed so many of you in the past, and he must have been crushed under a million tons of lavastone.  What a day to die!

Anyway, there is some good that comes out of this, otherwise I wouldn't be writing this.  I stumbled upon a new opening, where I was amazed to find a magical portal into a very special area.
Being Immortal, they honored me and demonstrated all their special magics and very intense armour and weaponry.  They tell me they do not like mortal as much, so if you venture there to try and get any of this equipment, I'd suggest you be careful.

I wouldn't want to you "die" or anything. NOT!
Scarab, the Harmful
