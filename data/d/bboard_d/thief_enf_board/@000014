Title: prodigy
Name: Fodao
Date: Mar 30

He never logs on...and when he does it is to leave some shitty note about how bad this game is being run...
He logged on here...wrote a nasty note of board *which is fine* but then took all the eq in guild storage and tossed it in trash can! Then admitted to it on board!
This is bullshit! I would like to see one of two things happen...actually I would like to see both things happen...but i will settle for one of two :)
1. boot prodigy from this guild!
2. maybe write the code for storage room so that you can't use it less you are level 5 or above...this way if prodigy is not booted well...I will make sure every time I am on he never reaches lev 5.
*Fodao*
