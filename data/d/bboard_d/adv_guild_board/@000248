Title: re TB

I just have one point to make TB....a month ago...before I had taken my break from shadow...everytime you logged on....I was told by you to leave town so I could die.
If I dared to leave town...you would hunt me...period...yes...I did have a fighting chance if I got the first hit in on you...and could grab a stun resis...but my point is...when you were on...it meant death...period.
I would even say I am not in a pk mood today...I am training...and you would still come after me and kill me and tell me that whenever I left town you would kill me.
Do not sit there and give the lectures of the right and wrongs of players continually killing people if you are guilty of it too...what was it grandma used to say?
people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones?
And the rl stuff I mentioned in my post...well it had nothing to do with you...I never had a problem with you doing that.
Also...I do agree...we need more players...and as for me...I do not kill non lords..in fact if somoene non lord asks for my help I normally give it *when I can* and it never really mattered if they were thief or priest since guilds don't matter.
