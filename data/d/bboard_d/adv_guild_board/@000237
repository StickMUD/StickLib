Title: Clan Update
Name: Tamarindo
Date: Mar 18

In an attempt to help speed up the process of getting the clan areas
out into the mud I am asking people who have coders here in those clans
to work on the clan areas, but no clan will have an advantage or
disadvantage area wise when these areas enter the mud.  Just different
looks.  Coding will have to match present specifications!

Just know we are doing everything we can to help get more fun out
into this mud and bear with us during this.  With the help of these
guys I will have more time to work on other stuff perhaps (Skills?).
We are getting more players now and clans are making things more
interesting... have to change with the times.
