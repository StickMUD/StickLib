This is a non-negotiable topic, but I thought even players would
be interested in these things =)  In time you will be reporting
all comments, problems to Arch Wizards =)

Shadowchaser Coding Staff

In some places, these words may mean positions - but in this mud
they mean actions and responsibilities, and they are honored names
that are earned rather then given.

Apprentice Wizard: areas
    Novice Wizard: better areas
           Wizard: super areas
    Senior Wizard: excellent areas, apprentice sponsor
     Elder Wizard: kingdom assist, apprentice sponsor
      Arch Wizard: kingdom, admin assist
         Co-Admin: mudlib, admin assist
            Admin: goals, theme, mudlib

Each of the four kingdoms will have at least one Arch Wizard, the
slot that is the communication link between the admins, wizards
and players.  There may also be arches for law, documentation and
balance as the mud grows.  The arches will be supported by Elder
and Senior Wizards who are viewed by the coders *and* players as
excellent area makers.  Wizards, Novice Wizards and Apprentice
Wizards will make up the rest of the coding staff.  Apprentices
will need to be sponsored into a kingdom by a Senior or Elder
Wizard who will help them learn to code.  This structure of staff
is not founded on creating red tape, but rather on efficiency and
an excellent communication network.
