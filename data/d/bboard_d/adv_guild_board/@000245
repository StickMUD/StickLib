Ok first of all..to give ya a lil bit of background into MY fight here...I killed someone cause they are in a different clan...because there is a clan war going on.
However...my goal was NOT to hunt the person every time they left town...UNTIL...after that person died...they brought rl into this game and insulted me on a channel.
RL belongs OUTSIDE of mud...and if this person felt they could insult me by brining it not only on the mud but on a channel none the less...I have NO problems killing them anytime.
Also...the person I killed WAS and still is lord level...I don't find it to be harassment...no action was taken by anyone to punish this person for they did so I will do it myself.
I play here to escape rl...not have someone try to throw it in my face and insult me to boot!
