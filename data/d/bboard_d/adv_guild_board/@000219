I agree and disagree with your points.  Since you argued for your case one way, I'll take the other side.

Stun can easily be removed from pk with stun-resis.  It is much more scarce in this mud, but I can think of at least 2 different places you can get some, and one of them is limitless.  *i'm not talking about thieven obsidian ring either, since there are no thieven demons)

"where xxx"  While maybe it should not be a lord skill, there should still be an item that lets you 'where' those people with less levels than you.  Afterall, that is a big reason to stay ahead of levels of your foe.  Levels + exp should be to your advantage in pk...it always does not end up that way.  


Teleport -- it's chances of success is low, and it's cost is high.  It also stuns you if you do not have stun resis!  And unless the player is idle, it is not really an effective player killing device.
