Although few will remember him here at StickMUD, I will always
remember the player Osbourne who hosted several of our StickMUD
parties and was one of the kindest people I will ever know as I
look back now.  He was always there to say, "Hey, want another
beer?" or tell us his famous stories.  We used to talk about the
mud as if it were cars or something.  Say a prayer at the Temple
Yard for him, and look to your fellow mudders for the fun that is
really in them while you still can... people are really great,
it is always about the people.

-Tamarindo aka Snap, as Osbourne would called me.
