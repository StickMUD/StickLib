Title: Honor, War, Balance
Name: Timebomb
Date: Mar  8

In the last few days, since wars have started, I've started noticed how off balance things can be..and I'd like to cite a few examples and see what ppl think.

First of all, Paralyze/Web -- I've always kinda objected to this, but used it against other guilds to make up for speed differences...
There is a case now where it is being used to mk people, myself included, exclusively.  This is not its purpose.  It also makes a priest vs. priest battle a one spell affair.  
I don't know about other people, but I like a good fight that takes many spells, has many people, etc etc etc
paralyze/web kinda take the fun out of it...and I'd like to offer 2 alternatives...
1) make it only usable on npc's
2) take it out altogether (this might also balance the exp rate of thieves and priests).
(bear in mind when i stay take it out, i'm not referring to crits..it's good to get one of those every once in a while).

Secondly, take out "where"
christ, what fun is it to where and go kill. half the fun of a pk is tracking the person down...or meeting them for a head-to-head battle.

Thirdly, take out "teleport" 
If you take where out, you have to take this out..because it makes things easier then where..simply teleport and have your attack ready *yawn*

You might argue for taking summon out, but I can't see a "fighting honor" reason to take it out.

I'd like to get feedback on everyone about these ideas...obviously, they'll all be gone when clans come anyway...but how about makign some effort to balance things in the mean time.  All are quick fixes..

Let's hear it.

TB.
