Ok, we will end the StickMUD talk for good now... most
here don't go there anymore anyways... I am going to
change my chars passwords there and forget them.

Again let me remind all of you - gather 500k and a team
member or two and make a clan, tribe, faction
whatever you want to call it I guess.  It is going to
take me a little time to get all of these open so
bear with me.
