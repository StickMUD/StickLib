Title: Cheat Issue

To all of Shadowchaser

I'd like to start by appologizing to all on this issue.  I have been punished severely for taking actions which would easily demonstrate cheating.  I completely and fully understand this punishment from Tamarindo's point of view.  Yesterday evening I worked with Ooze on the issue that his hedges would not regen in his area.  After several hours he had not been able to fix it, however a new bug was created.  The hedges constantly regened and allowed for easy kill.  During my time with Ooze I did easily double my exp, however with every realization this was something that would be lost.  This was discussed completely between Ooze and I, including the fact that Tamarindo would be alerted to this.  I wrong however when I logged back in today and continued to play the area for my own enjoyment.  As a coder I realized all of this was fully logged in the matters of exp gain, and in every way expected it to be fixed along with the bug and time I spent working on it to get this accomplished.    
My Sincere Appologies,

Paranoid
