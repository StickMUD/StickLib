Title: Remember
Name: Tamarindo
Date: Feb 28

Timebomb, I am very tired =)  I just wish for all people in all muds to
remember that we play these games for fun... not for mudlib, not for
admins to step on people, just for fun.  I loved playing a ninja, and
without Bull on my back and everyone elses I would be over 10dan black
and passed everyone in levels at StickMUD.  I was having so much fun.
I can't go back to being a player again, and I don't want people to bow
to me here because I am admin - coders know that is not how I operate.
I just want to bring back fun to everyone on the whole net if possible!
Real fun like back in the day ;)  It is sort of like on the Lion King
movie... "remember".  Remember who you are, who you were.  Reach it
again.  I want to be me, not what Bull forces me to be, or guild
masters, etc.  Welcome these clans and skills - freedom comes with
them to be your own character in your mud character.

I make a lot of mistakes along the way, but better to be making
them then stay inactive and wonder after years of idling on StickMUD
why I had the chance to so something to help out and didn't.
