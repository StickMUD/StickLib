Howdy,
   please help newbies out when they login... this is the
best thing you can do to help Shadowchaser and it is VERY
much necessary... it is more necessary then your exp/hr for
the night.  I am going to try and make things more newbie
friendly.  We are not going to be a mud of just players
from StickMUD... the mud will not survive that way... that
is a guarantee.  I am very serious about this one.
