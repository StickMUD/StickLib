Just a few suggestions for clans buildings...if ya care to hear them
First...make the weapons/armoury rooms be donation rooms to the clan where as members may borrow items...this keeps the clan weaponry and such to be used only by clan members as done in thief guild. This way it is not affected by raids
second...make guards at the entrance look at and recognize the player as a member/non member upon arrival.
hmms...and third...well it is after 3 am and I am tired so I will get back to you on that... :)
