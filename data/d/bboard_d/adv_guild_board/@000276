Title: More coders
Name: Tamarindo
Date: Apr  6

Howdy,
   by our best estimate we have now reclaimed all the
area space lost from the original StickMUD and now have
surpassed it with 11 areas lost and over 15 new areas
added =)  We wish to keep things moving, so if you have
access to anyone interested in coding on any mud, get
them here.  Summer time should be something really
rocking here.  I will be making more posts about some
other new ideas we have come up with to keep things
growing here.  Get as many people here as you can and
give a big thank you to the coders who are making this
mud more fun!
