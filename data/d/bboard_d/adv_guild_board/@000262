The air around human begins to vibrate as he speaks out a single word pointing
at you.
As Human releases a burst of magical powers at you, a bright cloud of pure
magical force envelopes you, making you scream in agony and feel the might of
Boccob.
You feel your mana being drained!
The overwhelming force of Human's prayer renders You stunned.
You can't move to do that!
