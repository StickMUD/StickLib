This is a message, I've received this afternoon from the Queen of faeries :

"Heyya Suldrun,
You know that we are building our own castle for a while,
you know too, that we need a lot of money to do this, but we are a bit low nowadays.
I send to you some of my lovely faeries, because I know that your city, Newbie York is full of generous donators.
Ask to your players to not kill my sisters faeries, because they act for a good reason.
Best regards,
Clementia, Queen of faeries.

P.S. Thank for me, all the generous donators, and say em, they'll visit our castle, once we'll finish it :)"

So, I hope you'll let free to collect donations the sweet faeries :)

Suldrun, donator.
