Title: Five!

Howdy,
   today marks our five month anniversary of being open =)  March
turned out to be our most productive month thus far in which we
added over 200 more playing rooms to the MUD - so many that there
was no reason to keep counting after 220 or so ;)  As I see it, 
this is exceptional progress!  The biggest controversy of the month
of course would be the hedges, which seem to be something we may
never forget, even if we try really really hard!  The clans have
become rather active lately, as well as the PK - which is cool in
my book.  Other then Clan O'Duren we have clan areas pretty much
ready to go into the mud... all we are waiting on now is figuring
out the guards for the clans, which should be wrapped up soonish.
With the low PK loss + global stun resistance, I would guess this
is a really cool time to be playing the game.  Believe it or not
there are quite a few more new areas being worked on for this month
=)  If you have not tried out our new areas yet you are missing out
on a lot, like potions and a lot more exp.  April begins a month
of planning for a new look to Shadowchaser, which all of you will
have a chance to help us with.  In May we will enter a new phase,
where a lot of stuff around here is going to begin getting a lot
better =)

Thank you to all of the players and coders who have helped make
this mud what it is today - much more then what it was, and with
a little bit of work and good planning more then we could have
ever dreamed it could be!

-Tamarindo
