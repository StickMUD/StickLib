Hi,
   I would just like to say the admin do have an official
positions on bringing real life issues into this virtual
world.  These things are stated simply in the 'help rules'
and have been there for quite some time now.  You can name
call people or whatever, but please don't attach any of
your insults to real life situations... it is not good for
the spirit of the game.

PS.  I did not read most of the notes posted about this,
or mails.  Just play the game
