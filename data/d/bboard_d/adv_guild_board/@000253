Hi,
   I would just like to say that the admin have no official
positions on the pk or other actions of the clans, nor an
interest if you are going to quit the mud due to them =)  In
this world there are three things you can do when the
environment changes up on you:

1. Adapt
2. Hide
3. Quit

I suggest a combination of 1 & 2 could be helpful, but I am
not a player anymore =)

Have fun,

-Tamarindo
