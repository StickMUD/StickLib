1. This is all new, no, everything is not set.  So you could argue for no wars, but also, some of my most favoriate times on stick where huge wars.

2.  In real life, if you had the option of either giving up some of the cash out of your wallet, or actually dying, you'd gladly give a little cash up.  
Why must everyone say, I'd rather die b4 I give that *** **** anything.  That to me isn't smart, not is it roleplaying.  How can you complain about dying if you can't keep your mouth shut...

3.  Peace treaties could be set up.  Be diplomatic...Build allies.  Get people to join you clan...It can be done!


4.  When I left a mud around 1994, I was a pretty high and dangerous player on stickmud.  When I returned, I was a lowly punk.  People had gotten so many levels and powers ect.  I think I was killed like 10times the first 3 days I played.  I remember Mutsuhito killed me in like 10seconds and said, "You aren't the real Scar, the real scar was a good pker, you suck".  I infact, new I sucked.  I did not shove my ass nor opinions on other players.  I had to swallow some pride so I did not get killed before I got built up.  No I did not bend over and get raped up the ***, but yes, I did keep my mouth pretty quiet.  

This is not compromising your situation, but to me a good strategy in roleplaying.  This is what roleplaying is about.  Keep growing stonger, build allies, until you can come to a point where you can over throw the head dogs.

As far as helping people start this mud...this is what all of us should be doing!!!!
I want players to come here!!! I try and help when I can!!!  If we have players get a few levels, they are more likely to stay!!!


But clan wars aren't bad either, as they can build interest in the mud.

We all have a responsibility here if we want the mud to grow and develop into a great place to play !
