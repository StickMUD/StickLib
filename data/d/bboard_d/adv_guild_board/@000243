Last time I checked...this was a ROLE PLAYING game...ie...fantasy...ie...fun...ie...a GAME! There are some people...no names mentioned....who seem to believe that when they get pked, it is personal...ie...a rl event!
Yes...there seems to be a war between clans atm...and yes...many people are dying....but last I checked it is a game...not some hit on your rl affairs. I know from exp that it is not fun to not ever be able to leave town cause you will die...
I have been through that...MANY times throughout the entire time I have ever played muds...and it does suck...but it also passes with time too...
I was playing yesterday and killed someone...and because he/she didn't like that they died...they tried to bring rl into it..well hell...they did...this person doesn't know...never has met me...yet took jabs at my rl...this is not a real mud player.
Come on people...if you can't realize this is a game...and PLAY the role you wish your character to be...then leave...rl was brought way too much into stick...lets not let that happen here.
