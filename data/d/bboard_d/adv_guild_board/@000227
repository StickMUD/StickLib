And could you change thiefs guild around..reminds me of Stick
And could you change temple yard..reminds me of Stick
And could you change the lord titles...reminds me of Stick
And could you change the 'score' display..reminds me of Stick
And could you change the layout of the town...reminds me of Stick
And could you change how the top lists are set up..reminds me of stick
And could you change ... 

umm Morcar, I think it reminds you of stick because underneath, IT IS STICK!
plus guilds will be removed eventually so you "wont be reminded too much
of Stick" unless every other fucking thing on this mud reminds you of stick.

Sorry for sarcastic note, I am tired and finally finished exams. I will go
get drunk now. Bye.
