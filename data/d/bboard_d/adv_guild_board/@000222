Title: Cheating
Name: Tamarindo

Paranoid was caught cheating on an obvious bug in the new mansion.
He more then doubled his total exp + stats in a period if less
than two days (much less time playing).  He has lost his coder and
some exp and stats.

Please report bugs that you find, you can get rewarded.  We have
an active coding staff here - things don't get by us so easily ;)
