Bat decides to begin his decaying process.
Bat has the strange feeling (the body seen from above and so on...you know).
Bat kisses the dust.
Bat is now a late Bat.
With a deafening crack, the air around you splits into its primal components.
The wind is sucked out of you and you begin to fall. A warm, protective healing
envelopes you and you feel as thought your body is being cradled gently in a
shielding embrace.
Suddenly someone skillfully stabs you on from behind completely into finely
minced meat! OUCH!!!
Someone pulls his weapon out of your back.
