Name: Ooze
Date: Mar  1

due to resent situations i can not and will not show ANYONE my area 
I will be happy to give my usal hints

also i cant not tell ANYONE where anything is or help them find it anymore

But i will be happy to talk to you

i am a player also and i think a player coder interaction should be pleasent

and i will try to help those who need help

This mud is going to be a pleasent relationship between coder and player

with this said i will be less seen around town
no longer will i abuse my powers
and continue to push out areas

Ooze
