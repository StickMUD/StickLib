Title: The next level
Name: Tamarindo
Date: Apr  3

Alright,
    time to get this started!  What I am going to do is introduce
you to what my interests are concerning the game and some ideas of
what I would like to see here in the not so distant future.  Doing
this will most likely take several posts.  You are invited to post
responses as to what you like and do not like, as well as add in
whatever constructive thoughts you may have to help add fun to our
new systems.  Keep your posts as brief as possible, and focus in
on the subject to help get your interest across to the rest of us
clearly!  Put in the subject one word concerning the topic to be
discussed, so it can be used later for reference (i.e. 'races' to
deal with races).

    There are three root subject areas things will stream off from,
which would be like the macro environment of the mud (kingdoms,
clan, skill, race relations), micro environment (npc, races, stats,
skills, levels, commands, colors) and the player/coder relations.
