okay..... quit killing me till you guys get the WHOLE story.... does that sound fair enough....?...
all the EQ that was in the Guild Storage was mine.... MINE.... all of it.... over 60 items.... all down to the last one.... were all stolen from my house.... and whoever did it to annoy me or whatever.... most of the EQ was Magus's anyways.... so you fukked up... all of this was done for no reason.... thank you...
anyways... I took MY EQ back.... and I get into trouble for it.... and start getting PK'ed before anyone even asks me about it.... thats brilliant.... shows intelligence on your part guys!.... so apparently the rules now state "Spoony is not allowed to own any EQ or gain any EXP." is that it? is my character against the rules in general? 
once again I state IT WAS MY EQ... 
anyways.... I stopped taking it back from the Guild Storage and am STILL being PK'ed for it.... I did nothing wrong to anyone.... broke no rules... and even gave into your wants and wishes to top it off.... and am still being PK'ed.... WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO MAKE YOU ALL HAPPY??? 
you asked me to stop taking all the stuff from the storage and Ive done that... now call off the price on my head.... Ive given you what you wanted.... you win.... now quit killing me....
