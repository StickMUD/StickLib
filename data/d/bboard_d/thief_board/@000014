Title: lockpick
Name: Nikki
Date: Dec 21

1st I opened punkin&mysticas house, sorry was just testing lockpick, its mostly harmless, i was surprised to have it work.
2nd i closed the door
3rd I think we should get rid of glowing lockpicks, perhaps make it a special item that some monster has.

I dont think it is very realistic to pick a door with little or no practice.
