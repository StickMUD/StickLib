i didn't bother to read the other notes, but...
If you asked a coder to check who was stealing eq from thief guild, that REALLY sucks.

Everyone should be able to betray his/her guild.
Thats why priests suck, when they cant kill other priests, or they cant heal excommed players.

THey cant betray their guild, like that anyways.

FOdao may be an enforcer, but so what, he shouldn't be helped by coders like that, i think that was a BIG insult to who ever that was who stole eq, well his RIGHTS.

COders may punish him if they want to, but they shouldn't help a mortal to punish him while coders are removing the steal logs and so on. This sucks. And btw, i emptied thief storage. and tossed all.

Long live who ever that was who stole eq.
