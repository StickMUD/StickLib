You are the one who needs to get the story straight! Whoever stole from you had to of sold your things because I was the one who filled the guild up with 40+ items the first and second time!
I did not take them from your home! I spent an hour going through mud and filling up the guild with eq! I leave the game come back later and guess what? All the eq is gone from the guild and it is YOUR name on log for taking it!
How many times do I have to tell you this...I FILLED UP THE GUILD STORAGE! I went through and killed the monsters and instead of selling them...tinned the corpses and brought tins and eq to guild storage for people to use!
I don't give a rats ass if someone stole from you! That is for you to deal with not me! What I am dealing with is the fact that you came to the guild and stole al the eq that was in here...TWICE!
Each time I found it empty...I filled the storage up! hell the tins that were in there should be proof enough I killed the fricking monsters!
This argument stops here! You were wrong! And I don't wanna hear you bitch about it anymore! In fact I won't! Take it as a threat or a promise...but I will not put up with it again!
*Fodao*
