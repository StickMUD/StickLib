for the sake of simplicity, i think that the rule should read..
you cannot pick another thief's unless.. 
A house is NOT considered a thief's unless only thieves reside in it. 
ie that eliminates all questions/problems resulting in the case where you have one thief-one and one non-thief residing in a house..
