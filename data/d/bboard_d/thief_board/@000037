YOU GO MAN!!!!!
as much as most of you hate to admit it.... he has a point... Coders shouldnt be giving out information AT ALL.... I dont care if he's your friend.... this MUD is a GAME.... and therefore.... you are CHEATING..... do you hear me??? CHEATING!!!!!!.... 
and especially with the clans now.... that information is off limits for a reason...... 
quit trying to make this a game of all the high level characters and the coders all being friends...... ROLE PLAY some day..... you might find it fun...
