Title: Fixed "feature"
Name: Tamarindo
Date: Nov 24

The resign and rejoin "feature" of getting higher skills when one
resigns and rejoins the guild at a higher level that he or she
joined with is fixed.  For the good of all thieves and the game
those who have become out of normal alignment by using this will
get a tumble penalty to where it should be as if they played in
the guild the whole time.  If anyone recognises any other "features"
please tell the coders about it ASAP, because you are only going to
hurt yourselves otherwise.  We will goto great lengths to keeping
the game fair for everyone - all are playing on the same field.
