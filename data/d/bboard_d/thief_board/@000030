I dont think the things stolen from my house in the first place should be up for grabs to any of the thieves.... what I found in the storage was mine in the first place.... my house has been stolen from 6 times in the last 3 days or so.... I found the EXACT same stuff that I was missing, in the storage... EXACTLY!!!.... down to the last skipper stone... so if anyones gotta be punished.... do it to whoever keeps stealing the stuff from my house.... and tell me thats not fair....
