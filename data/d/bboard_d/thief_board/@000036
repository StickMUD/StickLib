I usually don't bother to read notes here, but...

Everyone should be able to betray his/her own guild.  But if you donate eq to a guild storage monster, he should be able to tell you who was taking the eq.  Just because this monster doesn't happened to be coded that way, doesn't mean that the guild shouldn't be able to find out who is doing it.  

Now if someone steals gold or burglarizes another home, no, that should not/and will not be told.  But this was a much different matter.
