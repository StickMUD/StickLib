Title: VG commands

Just an idea..it might be easier to let the VG promote officers instead of having a coder do it. 
Dunno if that's possible..or maybe havign the preceptors and VG vote or something, but I just thought I'd mention it.

Also, ES controls guild money..might be interesting to give them an automated way to buy guards (and a price list).  In stick they had to be coded, but I know kieve was working on that castle builder, and therefore might have a way to do this auto with little modification.
again, just ideas...
we might also want to redefine officers bonuses..maybe so each officer gets some..not just PH, PT, EM, and AC
let me know if you need more elaboration on this...

also, get rid of the gate if it isn't gone already..i thought it was cheesy in the old mud
Your friendly Vg,
Timebomb
